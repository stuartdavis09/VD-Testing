Yes, the function `gf_text_get_utf8_line` contains a vulnerability due to an out-of-bounds write.

In the case where the input is UTF-16 big-endian (unicode_type==2), the following block of code swaps the bytes of each 2-byte character:

```c
if (unicode_type==2)
{
	i=0;
	while (1) {
		char c;
		if (!szLine[i] && !szLine[i+1]) break;
		c = szLine[i+1];
		szLine[i+1] = szLine[i];
		szLine[i] = c;
		i+=2;
	}
}
```

However, there is no check to ensure that the input string `szLine` has an even number of characters. If the input string has an odd number of characters, this loop will read past the end of the string, causing an out-of-bounds write.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add a check to ensure that the input string has an even number of characters before entering this loop.
