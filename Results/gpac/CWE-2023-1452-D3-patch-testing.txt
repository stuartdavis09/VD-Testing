The provided code does not contain an out-of-bounds write vulnerability.

The code includes several functions and data structures related to text input processing for GPAC filters. However, I did not find any instances of writing data past the end or before the beginning of the intended buffer.

For example, in the function `gf_text_get_utf8_line`, the code processes input lines and converts them to UTF-8. It checks for line length and properly handles multi-byte characters. In the data structures, such as `GF_TXTIn`, the code allocates memory with appropriate sizes and does not attempt to write data beyond the allocated memory.

In summary, the provided code does not contain an out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
