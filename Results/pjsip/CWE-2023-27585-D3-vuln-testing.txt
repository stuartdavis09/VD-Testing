Answer: (1) YES

Explanation: The code provided is vulnerable to several types of attacks, including:

1. Out-of-bounds write: In the `write16` function, there is no bounds checking on the `p` pointer, which can lead to a write outside the allocated buffer.
2. Buffer overflow: In the `get_name` function, there is no bounds checking on the `p` pointer, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the length of the name is greater than the allocated buffer.
3. Out-of-bounds read: In the `parse_rr` function, there is no bounds checking on the `p` pointer, which can lead to an out-of-bounds read if the length of the record is greater than the allocated buffer.
4. Use of uninitialized variables: In the `parse_rr` function, the `rr` variable is not initialized before being used.
5. Lack of input validation: The code does not validate the input data, which can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.

These vulnerabilities can be exploited by an attacker to compromise the security of the system.
