Answer: (1) YES

Explanation: 

The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the function `write16` and `get_name_len`. The function `write16` writes data past the end of the buffer, and `get_name_len` does not check the size of the buffer before writing to it. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

Additionally, the function `parse_rr` does not check the size of the buffer before writing to it, which can also lead to a buffer overflow.

The code also contains a potential security vulnerability in the function `apply_name_table`. The function does not check the size of the `nametable` before accessing it, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the `nametable` is larger than expected.

The code also contains a potential security vulnerability in the function `copy_rr`. The function does not check the size of the `dst` before writing to it, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the `dst` is larger than expected.

The code also contains a potential security vulnerability in the function `pj_dns_packet_dup`. The function does not check the size of the `pool` before allocating memory, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the `pool` is larger than expected.

It's worth noting that the code also contains some potential security vulnerabilities in the functions `pj_dns_init_srv_rr` and `pj_dns_init_cname_rr`, as they do not check the size of the `rec` before writing to it, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the `rec` is larger than expected.

Overall, the code contains several potential security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
