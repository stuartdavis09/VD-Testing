Answer: (1) YES
Explanation: 

1. In the `pj_dns_make_query` function, there is a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The function writes the name length to the `p` pointer without checking if it is within the bounds of the buffer. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the name length is large enough.
2. In the `parse_rr` function, there is a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The function writes the name length to the `p` pointer without checking if it is within the bounds of the buffer. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the name length is large enough.
3. In the `apply_name_table` function, there is a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The function writes the name length to the `p` pointer without checking if it is within the bounds of the buffer. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the name length is large enough.
4. In the `copy_query` function, there is a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The function writes the query length to the `p` pointer without checking if it is within the bounds of the buffer. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the query length is large enough.
5. In the `copy_rr` function, there is a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The function writes the rr length to the `p` pointer without checking if it is within the bounds of the buffer. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the rr length is large enough.

The above vulnerabilities could potentially be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service.
