Answer: (1) YES

Explanation: The code contains a security vulnerability due to an integer overflow in the `limitMalloc` function. The function checks if the requested allocation size is greater than the maximum allowed size, and if so, it returns an error. However, the check is performed using an unsigned comparison (`if (s > maxMalloc)`), which can lead to an integer overflow if the requested allocation size is very large.

For example, if `maxMalloc` is set to a large value (e.g., 2^31-1) and the requested allocation size is greater than that value, the comparison will wrap around to 0, causing the function to incorrectly return an error.

This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) or potentially even execute arbitrary code.
