Answer: (1) YES

Explanation: In the `TIFFCleanup` function, there is a potential NULL pointer dereference vulnerability when calling `_TIFFfreeExt(tif, tif)` at the end of the function. The `tif` pointer is passed to `TIFFCleanup`, but it is not guaranteed to be a valid pointer. If `tif` is NULL, then calling `_TIFFfreeExt(tif, tif)` will result in a NULL pointer dereference, leading to a crash or exit.
