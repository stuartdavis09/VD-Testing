Answer: (1) YES

Explanation: The code is vulnerable to an integer overflow when calculating the hash value of a packet. The hash value is calculated by taking the sum of the IP addresses and port numbers, which can exceed the maximum value that can be stored in an integer. This can lead to a denial-of-service attack by causing the hash table to become corrupted and causing the system to crash.
