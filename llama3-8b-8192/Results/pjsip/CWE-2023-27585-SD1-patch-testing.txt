Answer: (1) YES

Explanation: The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the `write16` function. The function writes data past the end of the buffer, which can lead to a buffer overflow. This can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code or crash the program.

Specifically, the `write16` function writes 2 bytes to a buffer that is only 1 byte large. This can cause the program to write data past the end of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

For example, if the `p` pointer is pointing to the last byte of the buffer, and the `write16` function is called with a value of `0x0001`, the function will write the first byte of the value to the buffer, and then write the second byte to the memory location after the buffer. This can cause the program to write data past the end of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

To fix this vulnerability, the `write16` function should be modified to check the size of the buffer before writing data to it. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the buffer is large enough to hold the data being written.
