Here is the output in the required format:

Data flow analysis of the given code snippet:
1. Sources:
	* `txt_in` (FILE pointer)
	* `unicode_type` (s32)
	* `szLine` (char pointer)
2. Sinks:
	* `szLine` (char pointer)
	* `sOK` (char pointer)
3. Sanitizers:
	* `gf_utf8_wcstombs` (utf8 to multibyte string conversion)
4. Unsanitized Data Flows:
	* (txt_in, szLine, no sanitization on file input)
	* (unicode_type, szLine, no sanitization on input type)
5. Final Vulnerability analysis verdict: vulnerability: YES
| vulnerability type: 787 |
| vulnerability name: Out-of-bounds Write |
| explanation: The function `gf_text_get_utf8_line` reads data from the file `txt_in` and stores it in the buffer `szLine`. The buffer size is not checked, which allows for potential out-of-bounds writes.
