Here is the output in the specified format:

Data flow analysis of the given code snippet:
1. Sources: 
	* `skb` (struct sk_buff) in `ipv4_link_failure` and `ipv4_send_dest_unreach`
	* `dst` (struct dst_entry) in `ipv4_dst_check`, `ipv4_mtu`, `ipv4_negative_advice`, `ip_do_redirect`, and `ipv4_dst_destroy`
	* `skb` (struct sk_buff) in `ip_do_redirect`
	* `sk` (struct sock) in `ip_do_redirect`
	* `daddr` (const void*) in `ipv4_neigh_lookup` and `ipv4_confirm_neigh`
2. Sinks: 
	* `NULL` in `ipv4_cow_metrics` (return value)
	* `__icmp_send` in `ipv4_send_dest_unreach`
3. Sanitizers: 
	* `WARN_ON(1)` in `ipv4_cow_metrics` (no sanitization, just a warning)
4. Unsanitized Data Flows: 
	* (`skb`, `NULL`, `skb` may be NULL, leading to a NULL pointer dereference)
	* (`skb`, `dst`, `skb` may be NULL, leading to a NULL pointer dereference)
5. Final Vulnerability analysis verdict: vulnerability: YES
| vulnerability type: 476 |
| vulnerability name: NULL Pointer Dereference|
| explanation: The code snippet contains several functions that can potentially dereference NULL pointers, leading to a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability.
