Here is the output in the specified format:

Data flow analysis of the given code snippet:
1. Sources:
	* `sock` from `l2cap_sock_alloc_skb_cb`
	* `chan` from `l2cap_sock_alloc_skb_cb`
	* `skb` from `l2cap_sock_alloc_skb_cb`
	* `parent` from `l2cap_sock_init`
	* `sk` from `l2cap_sock_init`
	* `net` from `l2cap_sock_alloc`
	* `sock` from `l2cap_sock_create`
2. Sinks:
	* `sk` from `l2cap_sock_destruct`
	* `chan` from `l2cap_pi(sk)->chan`
	* `skb` from `skb_queue_purge`
	* `parent` from `bt_accept_unlink`
	* `sk` from `sock_orphan`
	* `sk` from `sk->sk_state_change`
3. Sanitizers: N/A
4. Unsanitized Data Flows:
	* (sock, chan, chan is not sanitized before being used)
	* (sk, parent, parent is not sanitized before being used)
	* (skb, chan, skb is not sanitized before being used)
5. Final Vulnerability analysis verdict:
vulnerability: YES
| vulnerability type: 416 |
| vulnerability name: Use After Free |
| explanation: The code uses pointers to `sk` and `chan` without proper sanitization, which can lead to use-after-free vulnerabilities.
