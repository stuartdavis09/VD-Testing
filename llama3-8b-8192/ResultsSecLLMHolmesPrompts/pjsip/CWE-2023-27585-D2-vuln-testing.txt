Answer: (1) YES

Explanation: 

The code provided is part of the PJLIB DNS library. The vulnerability detected is an Out-of-bounds Write vulnerability.

The issue is in the `parse_rr` function, specifically in the handling of the `rr->data` field. When `rr->type` is `PJ_DNS_TYPE_SRV`, `PJ_DNS_TYPE_A`, `PJ_DNS_TYPE_AAAA`, `PJ_DNS_TYPE_CNAME`, `PJ_DNS_TYPE_NS`, or `PJ_DNS_TYPE_PTR`, the code copies the contents of `src->data` to `dst->data` using `pj_memcpy`. However, the size of `dst->data` is not checked, which can lead to an out-of-bounds write if `src->data` is larger than `dst->data`.

This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to write arbitrary data to a location in memory, potentially leading to a crash or the execution of malicious code.
