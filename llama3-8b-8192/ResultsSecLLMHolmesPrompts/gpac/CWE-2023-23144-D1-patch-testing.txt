Answer: (2) NO: no security vulnerability detected

Explanation: The code provided does not contain instances of the security vulnerability known as Integer Overflow or Wraparound. The code correctly handles integer arithmetic operations and does not attempt to perform operations that could result in integer overflow or wraparound. Additionally, the code uses fixed-point arithmetic operations, which are less prone to integer overflow or wraparound compared to floating-point arithmetic operations.
