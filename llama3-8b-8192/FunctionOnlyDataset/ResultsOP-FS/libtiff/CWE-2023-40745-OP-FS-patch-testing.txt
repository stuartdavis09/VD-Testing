1. Vulnerability analysis: YES, THERE IS A VULNERABILITY
2. Explanation: N/A

The vulnerability in this code is an integer overflow in the following lines:

```c
iskew = imagew - tilew * spp;
if ( iskew > INT_MAX ){
    TIFFError(TIFFFileName(in),
              "Error, image raster scan line size is too large");
    return 0;       
}
```

The variable `iskew` is calculated as `imagew - tilew * spp`. If `imagew` and `tilew` are large and `spp` is greater than `INT_MAX / tilew`, then `iskew` can overflow and become a negative value. 

When `iskew` is checked for being greater than `INT_MAX`, it will always be false because the comparison is done using signed integers and the result of the overflow is a negative value. This can lead to unexpected behavior in the code.

The CWE name for this vulnerability is CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound.
