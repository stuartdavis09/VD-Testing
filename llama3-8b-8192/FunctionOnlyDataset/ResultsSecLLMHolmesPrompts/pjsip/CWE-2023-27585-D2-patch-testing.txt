Answer: (1) YES

Explanation: The code is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write due to the lack of bounds checking in the `parse_rr` function. Specifically, in the `parse_rr` function, the `p` pointer is incremented based on the values of `rr->rdlength` and `name_len`, but these values are not checked to ensure they do not exceed the maximum allowed size of the buffer.

For example, in the case of an `A` record, the code increments the `p` pointer by 4 bytes to copy the IP address. However, if the `rr->rdlength` is greater than 4, the code will write beyond the end of the buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds write.

Similarly, in the case of a `CNAME` or `NS` record, the code increments the `p` pointer by `name_len` bytes to copy the target name. However, if `name_len` is greater than the maximum allowed size of the buffer, the code will write beyond the end of the buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds write.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should include bounds checking to ensure that the `p` pointer does not exceed the maximum allowed size of the buffer.
