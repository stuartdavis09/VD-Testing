Answer: (1) YES

Explanation: The code is vulnerable to out-of-bounds write in the `parse_rr` function. When parsing the DNS record, it allocates memory for the name and target name based on the length calculated by the `get_name_len` and `get_name` functions. However, it does not check if the allocated memory is sufficient to hold the entire name or target name. If the name or target name exceeds the allocated memory, it can lead to an out-of-bounds write, potentially causing a buffer overflow or underflow.

For example, in the `parse_rr` function, when parsing the CNAME or NS records, it allocates memory for the target name using `pj_pool_alloc`. However, it does not check if the allocated memory is sufficient to hold the entire target name. If the target name exceeds the allocated memory, it can lead to an out-of-bounds write. Similarly, in the case of the SRV record, it allocates memory for the target name and priority, weight, and port values, but it does not check if the allocated memory is sufficient to hold the entire target name and these values.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if the allocated memory is sufficient to hold the entire name or target name before copying the data into it.
