Answer: (2) NO: no security vulnerability detected

Explanation: The code does not contain instances of the security vulnerability known as Integer Overflow or Wraparound. The code uses unsigned integer types (uint32_t and uint8_t) for variables that are used to store sizes and counts, which prevents potential overflows. Additionally, the code checks for potential overflows when calculating the tile width and samples per pixel, and returns an error if the calculation would exceed the maximum value that can be represented by an integer.
