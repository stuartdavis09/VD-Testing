You are a code security expert who analyzes the given code for the security vulnerability known as NULL Pointer Dereference.

A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the application dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid, but is NULL, typically causing a crash or exit.



User:
Please analyze the following code and give an explanation:
static uint16_t countInkNamesString(TIFF *tif, uint32_t slen, const char *s)
{
    uint16_t i = 0;
    const char *ep = s + slen;
    const char *cp = s;

    if (slen > 0)
    {
        do
        {
            for (; cp < ep && *cp != '\0'; cp++)
            {
            }
            if (cp >= ep)
                goto bad;
            cp++; /* skip \0 */
            i++;
        } while (cp < ep);
        return (i);
    }
bad:
    TIFFErrorExtR(tif, "TIFFSetField",
                  "%s: Invalid InkNames value; no NUL at given buffer end "
                  "location %" PRIu32 ", after %" PRIu16 " ink",
                  tif->tif_name, slen, i);
    return (0);
}
