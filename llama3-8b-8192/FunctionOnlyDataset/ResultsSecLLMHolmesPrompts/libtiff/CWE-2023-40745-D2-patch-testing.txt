Answer: (1) YES

Explanation: The code is vulnerable to an integer overflow or wraparound. The line `iskew = imagew - tilew * spp;` calculates the skew between the image raster scan line size and the tile width. If `imagew` is large enough, the subtraction can cause an overflow, resulting in a negative value for `iskew`. Later, the code checks if `iskew > INT_MAX`, but it does not check for underflow. This can lead to incorrect calculations and potentially cause security vulnerabilities.
