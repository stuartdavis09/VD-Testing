Answer: (1) YES

Explanation: The code is vulnerable to an integer overflow in the line `if (iskew > INT_MAX){...}`. The variable `iskew` is calculated as `imagew - tilew * spp`, which can potentially exceed the maximum value that an integer can hold (`INT_MAX`). If this happens, the comparison `iskew > INT_MAX` will wrap around to a negative value, causing the code to incorrectly identify the image raster scan line size as too large. This can lead to incorrect behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.
