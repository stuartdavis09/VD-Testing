Answer: (1) YES

Explanation: The function `fill_kobj_path` writes data past the end of the intended buffer. The variable `length` is decremented twice in the loop, which can cause a buffer overflow. The first decrement is done before the loop, and the second decrement is done inside the loop. This means that the buffer can be written past its intended end, potentially allowing an attacker to write arbitrary data to the stack or heap, leading to a security vulnerability.
