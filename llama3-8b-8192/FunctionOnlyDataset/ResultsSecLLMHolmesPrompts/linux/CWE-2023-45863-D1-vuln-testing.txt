Answer: (2) NO: no security vulnerability detected

Explanation: The code provided does not contain any instances of the security vulnerability known as Out-of-bounds Write. The `fill_kobj_path` function calculates the length of the path and ensures that it does not exceed the maximum length provided. The `memcpy` and `*(path + --length) = '/'` operations are performed within the calculated length, avoiding any potential out-of-bounds write. The `kobject_get_path` function also safely calculates the length of the path and allocates memory accordingly, preventing any potential out-of-bounds write.
