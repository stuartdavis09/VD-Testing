Answer: (1) YES

Explanation: The `fill_kobj_path` function is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. The `length` variable is decremented before each `memcpy` operation, which can potentially lead to a write outside the bounds of the `path` buffer. This is because the `length` variable is not checked to ensure it is greater than zero before the `memcpy` operation. If the `length` variable becomes zero or negative, the `memcpy` operation will write data past the end of the `path` buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
