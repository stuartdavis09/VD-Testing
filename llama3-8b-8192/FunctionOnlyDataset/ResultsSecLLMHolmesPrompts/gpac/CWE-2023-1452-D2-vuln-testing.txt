Answer: (1) YES

Explanation: The code is vulnerable to an Out-of-bounds Write vulnerability in the following lines:

```c
if (unicode_type==3)
{
    i=0;
    while (1) {
        char c;
        if (!szLine[i] && !szLine[i+1]) break;
        c = szLine[i+1];
        szLine[i+1] = szLine[i];
        szLine[i] = c;
        i+=2;
    }
}
```

In this code, the variables `i` and `i+1` are used to access elements of the `szLine` array. However, there is no check to ensure that `i` and `i+1` are within the bounds of the array. This can lead to an Out-of-bounds Write vulnerability if `i` or `i+1` is greater than or equal to `lineSize`.
