Answer: (2) NO: no security vulnerability detected

Explanation: The code contains instances of out-of-bounds read operations, but not out-of-bounds write operations. The out-of-bounds read operations occur when the code accesses characters beyond the end of the input string (szLine) or when it accesses the input file (txt_in) beyond the end of the line. However, these operations do not allow an attacker to modify the code's memory, which is the definition of an out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
