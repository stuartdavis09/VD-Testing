Answer: (1) YES

Explanation: In the code, the variable `delta` is calculated as `delta = 1; for (i=0; i<NbComp; i++) { tang[i] = gf_tan(gf_mulfix(GF_PI/4, m_ft[i]) ); delta += gf_mulfix(tang[i], tang[i]); }`. The variable `delta` is an integer and is incremented by the sum of squares of `tang[i]` values. If `NbComp` is large, the sum of squares can exceed the maximum value that can be represented by an integer, causing an integer overflow. This can lead to a security vulnerability, as the code assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value.
