Answer: (2) NO: no security vulnerability detected

Explanation: The code provided does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities related to integer overflow or wraparound. The code correctly checks for potential issues when processing user input and file sizes. The calculations for determining the maximum allowed file sizes and buffer sizes do not appear to be susceptible to integer overflow or wraparound. Additionally, the code does not use any unchecked arithmetic operations that could potentially lead to an integer overflow or wraparound.
