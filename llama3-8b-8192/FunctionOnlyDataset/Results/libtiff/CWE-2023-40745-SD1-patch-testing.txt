Answer: (1) YES

Explanation: The code contains a potential security vulnerability due to an integer overflow. In the line `iskew = imagew - tilew * spp;`, the calculation can produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the value of `imagew` is large and `tilew * spp` is close to or exceeds the maximum value of an integer. This can lead to a buffer overflow or underflow when the value of `iskew` is used later in the code.
