Answer: (1) YES

Explanation: The code is performing a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, which can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or execution control.

Specifically, in the line `iskew = imagew - tilew * spp;`, the subtraction `tilew * spp` can result in an integer overflow if `tilew` and `spp` are large enough. This can cause `iskew` to wrap around to a negative value, which is not expected by the code.
