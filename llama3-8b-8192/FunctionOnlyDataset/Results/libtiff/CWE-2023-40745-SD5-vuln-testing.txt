Answer: (2) NO: no security vulnerability detected

Explanation: The code appears to be free from security vulnerabilities. It does not perform any calculations that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, which could introduce weaknesses when used for resource management or execution control. The code also does not have any obvious logical flaws or bugs that could lead to security issues. It simply reads and processes data from a TIFF file and stores it in a buffer, and it does not perform any calculations that could potentially overflow or wraparound.
