Answer: (1) YES

Explanation: The function `parse_rr` appears to be vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write. In the `else if` block where the type is `PJ_DNS_TYPE_AAAA`, `PJ_DNS_TYPE_CNAME`, `PJ_DNS_TYPE_NS`, or `PJ_DNS_TYPE_PTR`, the function `get_name` is called to extract the target name. However, the buffer `rr->rdata.cname.name.ptr` or `rr->rdata.srv.target.ptr` is allocated based on the `name_len` variable, which is calculated by the `get_name_len` function. If the `get_name_len` function returns an invalid value, the buffer may not be large enough to hold the extracted name, leading to an out-of-bounds write.

Additionally, the function `get_name_len` itself is also vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write. In the `while` loop, the variable `p` is incremented based on the value of `label_len`, which can be arbitrary. If `label_len` is large enough, `p` can exceed the bounds of the `max` buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds write.
