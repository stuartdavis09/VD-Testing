Answer: (1) YES

Explanation: In the `parse_rr` function, there is a potential out-of-bounds write vulnerability. The function `get_name_len` is called with the pointer `p` as the starting point, and the length of the name is calculated. Then, the function `get_name` is called with the same pointer `p` as the starting point, and the name is parsed. If the name contains a compression pointer, the function `get_name` recursively calls itself, passing the calculated offset as the starting point. However, there is no check to ensure that the calculated offset is within the bounds of the packet.

In the worst-case scenario, if the compression pointer points to a location outside the packet, the function `get_name` will write data outside the bounds of the packet, leading to a potential security vulnerability.
