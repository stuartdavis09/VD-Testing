Answer: (1) YES

Explanation: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The line `gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "slice_qs_delta");` reads an unsigned exponential-golomb encoded integer from the bitstream, but the length of the integer is not checked. This could potentially cause the program to write data past the end of the intended buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.
