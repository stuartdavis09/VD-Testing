Here is the output in the specified format:

Data flow analysis of the given code snippet:
1. Sources:
	* NbComp
	* NbBits
	* bs
	* i
	* dir
	* orient
	* value
	* sign
2. Sinks:
	* m_ft
	* delta
	* GF_OK
	* GF_BAD_PARAM
	* GF_NON_COMPLIANT_BITSTREAM
3. Sanitizers: N/A
4. Unsanitized Data Flows:
	* (bs, m_ft, unsanitized data from unknown external API)
	* (gf_bs_read_int(bs, NbBits), m_ft, unsanitized data from unknown external API)
	* (gf_mulfix(GF_PI/4, m_ft[i]), tang[i], unsanitized data from unknown external API)
	* (gf_tan(gf_mulfix(GF_PI/4, m_ft[i])), tang[i], unsanitized data from unknown external API)
	* (delta, m_ft, unsanitized data from unknown external API)
5. Final Vulnerability analysis verdict:
| vulnerability: YES |
| vulnerability type: 190 |
| vulnerability name: Integer Overflow or Wraparound |
| explanation: The code uses signed integers (s32) for some calculations, and there are several places where unsanitized data from unknown external APIs (gf_bs_read_int, gf_mulfix, gf_tan) is used. This could potentially lead to integer overflow or wraparound vulnerabilities.
