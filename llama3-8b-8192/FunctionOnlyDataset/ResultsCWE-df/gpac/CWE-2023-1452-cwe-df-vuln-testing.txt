Here is the output in the specified format:

Data flow analysis of the given code snippet:
1. Sources:
	* szLine
	* lineSize
	* txt_in
	* unicode_type
2. Sinks:
	* szLine
	* szLineConv
	* sptr
3. Sanitizers:
	* memset(szLine, 0, sizeof(char)*lineSize)
4. Unsanitized Data Flows:
	* (szLine, szLineConv, szLineConv is not sanitized)
	* (szLine, sptr, szLine is not sanitized)
5. Final Vulnerability analysis verdict: vulnerability: YES
| vulnerability type: 787 |
| vulnerability name: Out-of-bounds Write |
| explanation: The code snippet is vulnerable to out-of-bounds write due to the lack of proper sanitization of the input data. The szLine buffer is not properly sanitized before being used, which could lead to out-of-bounds writes.
