Here is the output in the specified format:

Data flow analysis of the given code snippet:
1. Sources:
	* szLine (input string)
	* txt_in (file pointer)
	* unicode_type (integer value)
2. Sinks:
	* szLine (output string)
	* szLineConv (temporary string buffer)
3. Sanitizers:
	* None
4. Unsanitized Data Flows:
	* (szLine, szLineConv, szLineConv is not sanitized before being copied to szLine)
	* (szLine, txt_in, gf_fgets does not sanitize the input)
5. Final Vulnerability analysis verdict:
| vulnerability: YES |
| vulnerability type: 787 |
| vulnerability name: Out-of-bounds Write |
| explanation: The code does not properly sanitize the szLineConv buffer before copying it to szLine, which can lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
