5. Final Vulnerability analysis verdict: vulnerability: YES
| vulnerability type: 787 |
| vulnerability name: Out-of-bounds Write |
| explanation: The code does not properly sanitize the data it receives from the input sources, potentially allowing an attacker to write data outside the bounds of a buffer.
