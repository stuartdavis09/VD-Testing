Here is the output in the required format:

Data flow analysis of the given code snippet:
1. Sources: 
	* kobject_name(parent)
	* kobject_name(kobj)
	* path
2. Sinks: 
	* memcpy(path + length, kobject_name(parent), cur)
	* *(path + --length) = '/'
	* pr_debug("kobject: '%s' (%p): %s: path = '%s'\n", kobject_name(kobj), kobj, __func__, path)
	* kfree(path)
3. Sanitizers: N/A
4. Unsanitized Data Flows: 
	* (kobject_name(parent), pr_debug("kobject: '%s' (%p): %s: path = '%s'\n", kobject_name(kobj), kobj, __func__, path), unsanitized user-controlled data is written to the debug log)
5. Final Vulnerability analysis verdict: 
vulnerability: YES
| vulnerability type: 787 |
| vulnerability name: Out-of-bounds Write|
| explanation: The function fill_kobj_path() does not properly validate the length of the path before writing to it, which could lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
