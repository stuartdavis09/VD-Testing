Here is the output in the required format:

Data flow analysis of the given code snippet:
1. Sources: 
	* `sock`
	* `sk`
	* `chan`
2. Sinks: 
	* `l2cap_sk_list`
	* `sock`
	* `sk`
	* `chan`
3. Sanitizers: N/A
4. Unsanitized Data Flows: 
	* (sock, sk, `sock->sk` is a pointer to a struct sock, and `sk` is used after `sock` is released)
	* (sk, l2cap_sk_list, `sk` is used after it is orphaned)
	* (chan, l2cap_pi, `chan` is used after it is released)
5. Final Vulnerability analysis verdict: 
| vulnerability: YES |
| vulnerability type: 416 |
| vulnerability name: Use After Free |
| explanation: The code snippet uses pointers to structs (`sock`, `sk`, `chan`) after they have been released, which can lead to a Use After Free vulnerability.
