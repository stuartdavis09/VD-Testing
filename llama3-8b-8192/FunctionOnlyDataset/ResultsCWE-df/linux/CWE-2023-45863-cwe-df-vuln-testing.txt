Here is the output in the specified format:

Data flow analysis of the given code snippet:
1. Sources:
	* `kobject_name(kobj)`
	* `kobject_name(parent)`
2. Sinks:
	* `pr_debug("kobject: '%s' (%p): %s: path = '%s'\n", ...`
	* `kobject_get_path()` returns the allocated memory
3. Sanitizers: N/A
4. Unsanitized Data Flows:
	* (`kobject_name(kobj)`, `pr_debug("kobject: '%s' (%p): %s: path = '%s'\n`, unsanitized user input)
	* (`kobject_name(parent)`, `pr_debug("kobject: '%s' (%p): %s: path = '%s'\n`, unsanitized user input)
5. Final Vulnerability analysis verdict:
vulnerability: YES
| vulnerability type: 787 |
| vulnerability name: Out-of-bounds Write|
| explanation: The `fill_kobj_path` function uses the `length` variable to index into the `path` array, but it is not properly bounded. The `length` variable is decremented multiple times without being checked against the actual length of the `path` array, which could lead to an out-of-bounds write.
