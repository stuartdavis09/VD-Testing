Here is the output in the specified format:

Data flow analysis of the given code snippet:
1. Sources:
	* `sock` (input parameter of `l2cap_sock_release`)
	* `sk` (member of `sock` struct)
2. Sinks:
	* `l2cap_sk_list` (list of sockets)
	* `chan` (member of `l2cap_pi` struct)
3. Sanitizers:
	* N/A
4. Unsanitized Data Flows:
	* (sock, l2cap_sk_list, the `sock` pointer is used after it is orphaned by `sock_orphan(sk)`)
	* (sk, chan, the `sk` pointer is used after it is killed by `l2cap_sock_kill(sk)`)
5. Final Vulnerability analysis verdict:
vulnerability: YES
| vulnerability type: 416 |
| vulnerability name: Use After Free |
| explanation: The code uses the `sock` and `sk` pointers after they have been orphaned or killed, which can lead to Use After Free vulnerabilities.
