Here is the output in the required format:

Data flow analysis of the given code snippet:
1. Sources: 
	* u (double)
	* v (double)
	* em (int)
2. Sinks: 
	* oog_encode(u, v)
	* uv_row[vi].ncum + ui
3. Sanitizers: N/A
4. Unsanitized Data Flows: 
	* (u, oog_encode(u, v), unsanitized user input)
	* (v, oog_encode(u, v), unsanitized user input)
	* (em, oog_encode(u, v), unsanitized user input)
5. Final Vulnerability analysis verdict: vulnerability: YES
| vulnerability type: 787 |
| vulnerability name: Out-of-bounds Write|
| explanation: The code snippet uses unsanitized user input (u, v, and em) as indices for arrays, which could lead to out-of-bounds writes if the input values are manipulated to access arbitrary memory locations.
