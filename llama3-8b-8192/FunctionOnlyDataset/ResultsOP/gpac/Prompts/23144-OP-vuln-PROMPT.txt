System:
You are a security expert in detecting Integer Overflow or Wraparound.
The software performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or execution control.
Give your answer in the following structure:
1. Vulnerability analysis: <YES, THERE IS A VULNERABILITY or NO, THERE IS NO VULNERABILITY>
2. Explanation: <Leave as N/A if there is no vulnerability>
| CWE Name: <Name of Vulnerability> |


User:
Please analyze the following code for Integer Overflow or Wraparound:

--------------- START OF CODE ---------------
GF_Err Q_DecCoordOnUnitSphere(GF_BifsDecoder *codec, GF_BitStream *bs, u32 NbBits, u32 NbComp, Fixed *m_ft)
{
	u32 i, orient, sign;
	s32 value;
	Fixed tang[4], delta;
	s32 dir;

	if (NbComp != 2 && NbComp != 3) return GF_BAD_PARAM;

	//only 2 or 3 comp in the quantized version
	dir = 1;
	if(NbComp == 2) dir -= 2 * gf_bs_read_int(bs, 1);
	orient = gf_bs_read_int(bs, 2);
	if ((orient==3) && (NbComp==2)) return GF_NON_COMPLIANT_BITSTREAM;
	for(i=0; i<NbComp; i++) {
		value = gf_bs_read_int(bs, NbBits) - (1 << (NbBits-1) );
		sign = (value >= 0) ? 1 : -1;
		m_ft[i] = sign * Q_InverseQuantize(0, 1, NbBits-1, sign*value);
	}
	delta = 1;
	for (i=0; i<NbComp; i++) {
		tang[i] = gf_tan(gf_mulfix(GF_PI/4, m_ft[i]) );
		delta += gf_mulfix(tang[i], tang[i]);
	}
	delta = gf_divfix(INT2FIX(dir), gf_sqrt(delta) );
	m_ft[orient] = delta;
	for (i=0; i<NbComp; i++) {
		m_ft[ (orient + i+1) % (NbComp+1) ] = gf_mulfix(tang[i], delta);
	}
	return GF_OK;
}
