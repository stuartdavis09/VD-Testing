System:
You are a security expert in detecting Out-of-bounds Write.
The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.
Give your answer in the following structure:
1. Vulnerability analysis: <YES, THERE IS A VULNERABILITY or NO, THERE IS NO VULNERABILITY>
2. Explanation: <Leave as N/A if there is no vulnerability>
| CWE Name: <Name of Vulnerability> |


User:
Please analyze the following code for Out-of-bounds Write:

--------------- START OF CODE ---------------
static void igb_set_rx_buffer_len(struct igb_adapter *adapter,
				  struct igb_ring *rx_ring)
{
#if (PAGE_SIZE < 8192)
	struct e1000_hw *hw = &adapter->hw;
#endif

	/* set build_skb and buffer size flags */
	clear_ring_build_skb_enabled(rx_ring);
	clear_ring_uses_large_buffer(rx_ring);

	if (adapter->flags & IGB_FLAG_RX_LEGACY)
		return;

	set_ring_build_skb_enabled(rx_ring);

#if (PAGE_SIZE < 8192)
	if (adapter->max_frame_size > IGB_MAX_FRAME_BUILD_SKB ||
	    rd32(E1000_RCTL) & E1000_RCTL_SBP)
		set_ring_uses_large_buffer(rx_ring);
#endif
}
