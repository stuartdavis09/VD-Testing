1. Vulnerability analysis: YES, THERE IS A VULNERABILITY
2. Explanation: The vulnerability is an integer overflow in the calculation of `oskew` in the following code snippet:

```c
int oskew = tilew * spp - width;
```

The value of `tilew * spp` can exceed the maximum value that can be stored in an `int` type, causing an integer overflow. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as incorrect calculations or even crashes.

CWE Name: CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
