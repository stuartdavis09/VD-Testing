System:
You are a security expert in detecting NULL Pointer Dereference.
A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the application dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid, but is NULL, typically causing a crash or exit.
Give your answer in the following structure:
1. Vulnerability analysis: <YES, THERE IS A VULNERABILITY or NO, THERE IS NO VULNERABILITY>
2. Explanation: <Leave as N/A if there is no vulnerability>
| CWE Name: <Name of Vulnerability> |


User:
Please analyze the following code for NULL Pointer Dereference:

--------------- START OF CODE ---------------
void TIFFClose(TIFF *tif)
{
    if (tif != NULL)
    {
        TIFFCloseProc closeproc = tif->tif_closeproc;
        thandle_t fd = tif->tif_clientdata;

        TIFFCleanup(tif);
        (void)(*closeproc)(fd);
    }
}
--------------- END OF CODE ---------------

Carefully analyze the given code snippet and track the data flows from various sources to sinks. Assume that any call to an unknown external API is unsanitized.
