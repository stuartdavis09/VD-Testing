1. Vulnerability analysis: YES, THERE IS A VULNERABILITY
2. Explanation: The vulnerability is a NULL Pointer Dereference in the function `_TIFFCleanup()` at the line `_TIFFfreeExt(NULL, tif);`. 

The function `_TIFFfreeExt()` is passed `NULL` as its first argument, which is a pointer to be freed. This is a NULL pointer dereference, which can cause a crash or exit. 

The function `_TIFFCleanup()` is called from `TIFFClose()` which in turn is called from `TIFFOpen()`. This means that any file opened with `TIFFOpen()` can potentially cause a NULL pointer dereference when it is closed. 

CWE Name: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
