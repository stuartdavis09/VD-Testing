Answer: (1) YES

Explanation: The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the `write16` function. The function writes data past the end of the buffer, which can lead to a buffer overflow. This can be exploited by an attacker to inject arbitrary code into the system.

In the `write16` function, the line `p[0] = (pj_uint8_t)(val >> 8);` writes 2 bytes to the buffer `p`, but the buffer size is not checked before writing. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the value `val` is larger than the buffer size.

Additionally, the code also contains a lack of bounds checking, which can lead to further vulnerabilities. For example, in the `get_name_len` function, the code does not check if the `name_len` variable is within the valid range before using it. This can lead to a buffer overflow or other types of vulnerabilities.

It is recommended to fix the buffer overflow vulnerability by adding proper bounds checking and validation of user input.
