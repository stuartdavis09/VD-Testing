Answer: (1) YES

Explanation: The code contains a potential security vulnerability in the `limitMalloc` function. The function checks if the requested memory allocation size is greater than the maximum allowed size `maxMalloc`, and if so, it returns `NULL` and prints an error message. However, the function does not check if the requested memory allocation size is less than or equal to the maximum allowed size, which could potentially lead to a buffer overflow.

For example, if the `maxMalloc` value is set to a small value, and the requested memory allocation size is larger than that, the function will return `NULL` and print an error message. However, if the requested memory allocation size is less than or equal to the maximum allowed size, the function will return a valid memory address, which could potentially lead to a buffer overflow.

To fix this vulnerability, the function should check if the requested memory allocation size is less than or equal to the maximum allowed size, and if so, return `NULL` and print an error message.
