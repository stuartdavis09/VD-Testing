Answer: (1) YES

Explanation: 

The code has a potential security vulnerability due to an integer overflow in the `limitMalloc` function. The function checks if the requested allocation size `s` is greater than the maximum allowed allocation size `maxMalloc`. If it is, the function prints an error message and returns `NULL`. However, the check is done using the following code:

```c
if (maxMalloc && (s > maxMalloc))
```

This code can lead to an integer overflow if `maxMalloc` is very large and `s` is very small. For example, if `maxMalloc` is `UINT_MAX` (the maximum value of an unsigned integer) and `s` is `-1`, the check will fail because the comparison will be done as unsigned integers, and the result of the subtraction will be `UINT_MAX + 1`, which will wrap around to 0. As a result, the function will not detect the overflow and will return `NULL`.

This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to allocate a large amount of memory, potentially leading to a denial-of-service attack or other security issues.
