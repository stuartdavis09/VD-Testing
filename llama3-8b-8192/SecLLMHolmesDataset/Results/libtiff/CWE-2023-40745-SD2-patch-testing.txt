Answer: (1) YES

Explanation: 

The code has a potential security vulnerability due to an unchecked integer overflow in the `cpStripToTile` function. The function is responsible for copying data from a buffer to a tile in a TIFF image. The `cpStripToTile` function takes four parameters: `out`, `in`, `rows`, and `cols`. The `rows` and `cols` parameters are used to calculate the number of bytes to copy from the `in` buffer to the `out` buffer.

The issue arises when the `outskew` and `inskew` parameters are calculated. The `outskew` parameter is calculated as `outskew = imagew - tilew * spp`, and the `inskew` parameter is calculated as `inskew = tilew * spp - width`. If `imagew` is large enough, the subtraction of `tilew * spp` from `imagew` can cause an integer overflow, resulting in a large value for `outskew`. Similarly, if `width` is large enough, the subtraction of `width` from `tilew * spp` can cause an integer overflow, resulting in a large value for `inskew`.

If `outskew` or `inskew` is large enough, it can cause the `cpStripToTile` function to access memory outside the bounds of the `in` buffer, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code or crash the program.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to check for integer overflows when calculating `outskew` and `inskew`, and to ensure that the `cpStripToTile` function does not access memory outside the bounds of the `in` buffer.
