3. Sanitizers: N/A
4. Unsanitized Data Flows:
   1. (GF_BitStream *bs, gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, ...), input data from unknown source is written to the output without sanitization)
   2. (GF_BitStream *bs, gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, ...), input data from unknown source is written to the output without sanitization)
   3. (GF_BitStream *bs, gf_bs_read_se_log(bs, ...), input data from unknown source is written to the output without sanitization)
   ...
5. Final Vulnerability analysis verdict: vulnerability: YES
| vulnerability type: 787 |
| vulnerability name: Out-of-bounds Write |
| explanation: The code does not properly validate the input data from unknown sources, allowing potential out-of-bounds writes to occur.
