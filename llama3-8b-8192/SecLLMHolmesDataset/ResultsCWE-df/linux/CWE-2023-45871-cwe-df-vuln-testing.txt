Here is the output in the required format:

Data flow analysis of the given code snippet:
1. Sources:
	* `igb_pci_tbl` (array of `struct pci_device_id`)
	* `igb_info_tbl` (array of `const struct e1000_info *`)
	* `debug` (module parameter)
	* `max_vfs` (module parameter)
2. Sinks:
	* `igb_pci_tbl` (array of `struct pci_device_id`)
	* `igb_info_tbl` (array of `const struct e1000_info *`)
	* `debug` (module parameter)
	* `max_vfs` (module parameter)
3. Sanitizers: N/A
4. Unsanitized Data Flows:
	* (igb_pci_tbl, igb_pci_tbl, igb_pci_tbl is not sanitized)
	* (igb_info_tbl, igb_info_tbl, igb_info_tbl is not sanitized)
	* (debug, debug, debug is not sanitized)
	* (max_vfs, max_vfs, max_vfs is not sanitized)
5. Final Vulnerability analysis verdict:
vulnerability: NO
