Answer: (1) YES

Explanation: The code contains a security vulnerability due to an unchecked integer overflow in the `cpStripToTile` function. The function calculates the offset `outskew` and `inskew` as follows:

```c
out += outskew;
in += inskew;
```

The variables `outskew` and `inskew` are calculated as follows:

```c
iskew = imagew - tilew * spp;
outskew = tilew * spp - width;
```

If `imagew` is very large and `tilew * spp` is close to `INT_MAX`, the calculation of `iskew` and `outskew` can result in an integer overflow. This can cause the program to write outside the bounds of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability.

Additionally, the `cpStripToTile` function does not check for buffer overflows when writing to the buffer `obuf`. This can also lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.

The `limitMalloc` function is used to enforce a maximum allocation size, but this is not sufficient to prevent the integer overflow vulnerability.
