Answer: (1) YES: a security vulnerability is detected

Explanation: The security vulnerability detected is a NULL pointer dereference in the function `_TIFFfreeExt`. In the function `TIFFCleanup`, the line `_TIFFfreeExt(NULL, tif);` calls the function `_TIFFfreeExt` with a NULL pointer as the first argument. This can cause a NULL pointer dereference if the function `_TIFFfreeExt` does not handle NULL pointers correctly.
