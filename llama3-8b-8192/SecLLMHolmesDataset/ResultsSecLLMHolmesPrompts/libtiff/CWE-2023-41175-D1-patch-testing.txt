Answer: 2

Explanation: The code provided is a TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) converter from raw data, and it does not contain any instances of the security vulnerability known as Integer Overflow or Wraparound. The code uses `uint16_t` and `uint32_t` types for variables that store image dimensions, and it checks for potential overflows when calculating the size of the output TIFF file. Additionally, it uses `UINT_MAX` and `_TIFF_off_t` types to ensure that the calculations do not exceed the maximum value that can be represented by the underlying system. Therefore, the code does not contain any instances of Integer Overflow or Wraparound.
