Answer: (1) YES

Explanation: The security vulnerability detected is a NULL pointer dereference in the function `_TIFFCleanup()`. The function `_TIFFfreeExt(NULL, tif);` is called at the end of the function, which attempts to free the `tif` pointer. However, if the `tif` pointer is NULL, this will result in a NULL pointer dereference, causing a crash or exit.

The function `_TIFFCleanup()` is called by `TIFFClose()`, which means that if `tif` is NULL when `TIFFClose()` is called, this vulnerability will be triggered.
