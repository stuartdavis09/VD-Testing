1. Vulnerability analysis: YES, THERE IS A VULNERABILITY

Explanation: 
In the given code snippet, there are several places where integer overflows can occur, which can lead to a vulnerability. 

1. In the `limitMalloc` function, the code checks if the requested allocation size is greater than the maximum allowed size (`maxMalloc`). If it is, the function returns `NULL`. However, if the requested size is equal to `maxMalloc`, the function will still allocate the memory. This can lead to an integer overflow if `maxMalloc` is large enough.

2. In the `cpStripToTile` function, the code calculates the number of bytes to be written to the output buffer. It does this by multiplying the number of samples per pixel (`spp`) with the bytes per sample (`bytes_per_sample`). If `spp` or `bytes_per_sample` is large enough, this multiplication can cause an integer overflow.

3. In the `readSeparateTilesIntoBuffer` function, the code calculates the number of bytes to be read from the input buffer. It does this by multiplying the number of samples per pixel (`spp`) with the bytes per sample (`bytes_per_sample`). If `spp` or `bytes_per_sample` is large enough, this multiplication can cause an integer overflow.
