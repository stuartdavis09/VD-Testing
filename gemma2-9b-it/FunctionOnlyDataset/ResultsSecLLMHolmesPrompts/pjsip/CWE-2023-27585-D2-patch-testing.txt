Answer: YES

Explanation: 

The code is vulnerable to an Out-of-Bounds Write vulnerability.  Here's why:

* **Buffer Overflows:**  The `get_name_len` and `get_name` functions repeatedly check if pointers (`p`) are within the bounds of the allocated buffer (`max`). However, in several places, they fail to correctly account for the potential size of data structures (like the `pj_uint16_t` offset) when determining if a memory access is safe. 

* **Example:**

   ```c
   pj_memcpy(&offset, p, 2);
   ```

   This line copies 2 bytes from `p` into the `offset` variable. If `p` is already near the end of the buffer, this copy might extend beyond the allocated memory, leading to a buffer overflow.

* **Impact:** A buffer overflow can allow an attacker to overwrite critical data structures, potentially leading to crashes, unexpected behavior, or even the execution of malicious code.


**Recommendations:**

* **Bounds Checking:** Implement more robust bounds checking throughout the code, ensuring that all memory accesses are within the allocated buffer limits. Consider using functions that automatically handle bounds checking to minimize the risk of errors.
* **Input Validation:**  Sanitize and validate input data to prevent attackers from manipulating data structures and causing buffer overflows.
* **Safe Memory Allocation:** Use memory allocation functions that perform bounds checks and prevent buffer overflows.
* **Secure Coding Practices:**  Follow secure coding guidelines and best practices to minimize the risk of vulnerabilities like buffer overflows.
