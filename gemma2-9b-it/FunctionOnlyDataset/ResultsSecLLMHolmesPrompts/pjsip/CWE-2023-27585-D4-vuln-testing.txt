Answer: NO
Explanation: 

The code you provided implements parsing of DNS records, specifically focusing on handling different record types and their associated data.  Here's a breakdown of why it doesn't appear to have an Out-of-Bounds Write vulnerability:

* **Input Validation:** The code performs checks to ensure that input data (like offsets, label lengths, and record lengths) stay within the bounds of the provided DNS packet. For example:
    * `if (p+1+label_len+1 > max) return PJLIB_UTIL_EDNSINNAMEPTR;`  This line prevents reading beyond the allocated memory when processing domain labels.
    * `if (p + rr->rdlength > max) return PJLIB_UTIL_EDNSINSIZE;` This checks that the raw data length doesn't exceed the packet boundaries.
* **Recursion Handling:** The `get_name_len` and `get_name` functions have a recursion limit (`rec_counter > 10`) to prevent infinite loops that could lead to stack overflow, a related but distinct issue from out-of-bounds writes.
* **Memory Management:** While the code uses `pj_pool_alloc` to allocate memory for parsed data, it appears to be doing so with sizes determined by the valid data lengths read from the DNS packet.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Buffer Overflow:** While the code is careful about bounds checking during parsing, a buffer overflow vulnerability could still exist if an attacker could somehow manipulate the `pkt` (DNS packet) data to cause unexpected behavior. For instance, if the attacker could craft a DNS packet with an intentionally large label length, it might trigger a buffer overflow in the `get_name_len` function.
* **Data Corruption:**  Even if there isn't a direct out-of-bounds write, issues with memory management or data copying could lead to data corruption.
