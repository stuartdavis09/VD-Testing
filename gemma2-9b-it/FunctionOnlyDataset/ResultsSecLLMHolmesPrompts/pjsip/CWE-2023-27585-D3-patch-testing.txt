Answer: NO
Explanation: The code you provided does not exhibit an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. 

Here's why:

* **Careful Length Checks:** The code performs extensive checks to ensure that memory accesses remain within the bounds of allocated buffers. 
    *  `get_name_len` and `get_name` functions repeatedly validate that pointers and offsets do not exceed the limits of the input packet (`pkt`) and the allocated memory.
    *  `parse_rr` similarly checks that the `rdlength` field and subsequent data accesses do not overrun the allocated space.

* **Error Handling:** When potential out-of-bounds access is detected, the code returns specific error codes (`PJLIB_UTIL_EDNSINNAMEPTR`, `PJLIB_UTIL_EDNSINSIZE`, `PJLIB_UTIL_EDNSINCLASS`), indicating the issue. This prevents the program from continuing with potentially corrupted data.

* **Recursion Limits:** The `rec_counter` variable in `get_name_len` and `get_name` acts as a safeguard against infinite recursion in case of malformed input.


**Key Points:**

While the code handles compressed domain names, which can introduce complexity, the thorough length checks and error handling effectively mitigate the risk of out-of-bounds writes.
