Answer: NO
Explanation: The code you provided does not exhibit an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. 

Here's why:

* **Careful Bounds Checking:** The code extensively checks array bounds and memory limits throughout the parsing process.  
    * `get_name_len` and `get_name` functions ensure that label lengths and offsets don't exceed the allocated buffer space.
    * `parse_rr` validates the `rdlength` against the remaining packet data and allocates memory accordingly.

* **Recursion Safety:** The `rec_counter` variable limits recursion depth, preventing infinite loops and potential buffer overflows that could arise from excessive recursive calls.

* **Data Type Handling:** The code correctly uses functions like `pj_memcpy` and `pj_ntohl/ntohs` to handle data conversions between network byte order and host byte order, minimizing the risk of memory corruption.
