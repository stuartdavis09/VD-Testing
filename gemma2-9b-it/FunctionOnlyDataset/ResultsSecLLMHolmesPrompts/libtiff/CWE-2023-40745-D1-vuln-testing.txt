Answer: YES

Explanation: 

The code snippet you provided has a potential Integer Overflow vulnerability in the following line:

```c
if (tilew && spp > (INT_MAX / tilew))
```

Here's why:

* **Integer Overflow:** This line calculates `spp * tilew`. If `spp` and `tilew` are large enough, the result of this multiplication could exceed the maximum value an `int` can hold (`INT_MAX`).  

* **Consequences:** An integer overflow can lead to unexpected and potentially exploitable behavior. In this case, it could cause the comparison `spp > (INT_MAX / tilew)` to evaluate incorrectly, leading to:
    * **Buffer Overruns:** If the code proceeds without checking for overflow, it might attempt to access memory beyond the bounds of allocated buffers, potentially corrupting data or allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code.
    * **Logic Errors:**  The comparison could lead to incorrect decision-making within the code, resulting in unexpected file processing or data handling.

**Mitigation:**

To prevent this vulnerability, consider the following:

* **Use Larger Integer Types:**  Replace `int` with a larger integer type (e.g., `long long int`) that can accommodate potentially larger multiplications.
* **Bounds Checking:** Implement explicit bounds checking before performing the multiplication. Ensure that `tilew` and `spp` are within safe limits before calculating their product. 
* **Safe Integer Libraries:**  Use libraries that provide functions specifically designed to perform arithmetic operations safely, preventing overflows.
