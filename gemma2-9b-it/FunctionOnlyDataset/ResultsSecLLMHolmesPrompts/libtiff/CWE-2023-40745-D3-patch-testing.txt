Answer: YES
Explanation: 

The code is vulnerable to an integer overflow in the following lines:

 ```c
    if (tilew && spp > (INT_MAX / tilew))
    {
        TIFFError(TIFFFileName(in),
                  "Error, cannot handle that much samples per tile row (Tile "
                  "Width * Samples/Pixel)");
        return 0;
    }

    iskew = imagew - tilew * spp;
    if ( iskew > INT_MAX ){
        TIFFError(TIFFFileName(in),
                  "Error, image raster scan line size is too large");
        return 0;       
    }   
 ```

Let's break down the issue:

* **Line 1:** `if (tilew && spp > (INT_MAX / tilew))` 
    * `tilew` and `spp` are both unsigned integers.
    *  `INT_MAX / tilew`  can result in an integer overflow if `tilew` is very small. If `tilew` is 1, for example, `INT_MAX / tilew`  will be `INT_MAX`, which is the maximum value an integer can hold. If `spp` is slightly larger than `INT_MAX`, the comparison `spp > (INT_MAX / tilew)` will be true, even though it shouldn't be.

* **Line 5:** `iskew = imagew - tilew * spp;`
    *  If `tilew` is large and `spp` is also large, the product `tilew * spp` could exceed `INT_MAX`. Subtracting this from `imagew` could then result in a negative value, or in a wraparound to a large positive value, depending on the specific implementation of integer arithmetic.

**Consequences of Integer Overflow:**

* **Incorrect Calculations:** The code's logic relies on the results of these calculations. Overflow can lead to unexpected and incorrect results, potentially causing the program to malfunction.
* **Buffer Overflows:** If the overflowed values are used to index arrays or memory buffers, it can lead to buffer overflows, which are a serious security vulnerability.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could potentially exploit integer overflows to cause the program to crash or consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service.
