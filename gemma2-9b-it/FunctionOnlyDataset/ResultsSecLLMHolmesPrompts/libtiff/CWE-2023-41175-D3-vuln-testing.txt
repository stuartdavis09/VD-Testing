Answer: YES 
Explanation: The code is vulnerable to integer overflow in several places. 

Here's a breakdown:

* **`while (sum < INT_MAX)`:** This loop continues as long as the `sum` variable is less than the maximum value an integer can hold (`INT_MAX`). If the input data causes `sum` to exceed `INT_MAX`, the comparison will wrap around due to integer overflow, leading to an infinite loop.
* **`rowsperstrip = (uint32_t)-1;`:** Setting `rowsperstrip` to `-1`  could lead to issues depending on how `TIFFDefaultStripSize` handles this value. It might interpret it as a maximum value, potentially causing an overflow if `TIFFDefaultStripSize` calculates a value larger than the maximum representable integer.

**Consequences:**

* **Infinite Loops:**  The infinite loop caused by the `while` condition could consume excessive system resources and potentially crash the program.
* **Unexpected Behavior:** Overflowing `rowsperstrip` could lead to incorrect strip sizes being written to the output file, corrupting the image data.
