Answer: NO 

Explanation: 

Let's break down the code and analyze it for potential NULL pointer dereference vulnerabilities:

1. **Input Check:** The function starts with a crucial safety check: `if (tif != NULL)`. This ensures that the `tif` pointer is not NULL before proceeding.

2. **Accessing Members:** Inside the `if` block, the code accesses members of the `tif` structure: `tif->tif_closeproc` and `tif->tif_clientdata`. These accesses are only performed if `tif` is not NULL, mitigating the risk of dereferencing a NULL pointer.

3. **Function Call:** The core potential vulnerability lies in the line `(void)(*closeproc)(fd);`. Here's why it's safe:
   - `tif->tif_closeproc` is a pointer to a function (`TIFFCloseProc`). 
   - This function pointer is retrieved only if `tif` is not NULL.
   - `(*closeproc)(fd)` calls the function pointed to by `closeproc` with the argument `fd`.  Since `closeproc` is guaranteed to be valid (non-NULL) at this point, calling it with `fd` is safe.

4. **Cleanup:**  The `TIFFCleanup(tif);` call ensures proper resource cleanup, further reducing the risk of issues.

**Conclusion:**

The code implements robust checks to prevent NULL pointer dereferences.  The access to members of `tif` and the function call through `closeproc` are only performed when `tif` is not NULL, making the code safe from this vulnerability.
