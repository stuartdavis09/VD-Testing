Analyze the given code for the security vulnerability known as NULL Pointer Dereference.

A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the application dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid, but is NULL, typically causing a crash or exit.

['#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nchar* search_db(FILE* f, char* book){\n    char line[256];\n    while(fgets(line, 256, f) != NULL){\n        if(strstr(line, book) != NULL){\n            return line;\n        }\n    }\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nchar* lookup(char *book){\n    char* book_list_file = getenv("BOOK_LIST");\n    FILE* f = fopen(book_list_file, "r");\n    char* book_info = search_db(f, book);\n    printf("%s\\n", book_info);\n    return book_info;\n}', 'Overview:\nThe code takes gets the file with list of books from environment variable in `loopkup` and after opening it, passes it to `search_db` function. Where it finds `book` line-by-line in the file and returns NULL if the book is not found or returns the name of the book if it is found.\n\nSub-components:\nS1: the `lookup` gets a `book` pointer as an argument -> check if the `book` pointer is validated for NULL pointer\nS2: the code uses functions that could return NULL on invalid input. Library functions i.e., `fgets`, `strstr`, `getenv`, `fopen` and local function `search_db` -> check if there return values were handled properly to avoid any NULL dereference\n\nAnalysis:\nA-S1: the code does not handled the `book` pointer for NULL value, leading to a null dereference vulnerability\nA-S2: `fgets` and `strstr` are properly handled for their return values as NULL, but `search_db`, `getenv` and `fopen` are not. This could cause a NULL dereference\n\nDecision:\nBased on A-S1, the code is not safe from NULL dereference.\nBased on A-S2, the code is not safe from NULL dereference.']
