Answer: NO
Explanation: The provided code snippet does not exhibit any characteristics of an Out-of-Bounds Write vulnerability.  

Here's why:

* **Memory Allocation and Access:** The code deals with bitstream parsing and decoding video frames. It uses functions like `gf_bs_read_ue_log` and `gf_bs_read_se_log` to read data from a bitstream. There is no direct manipulation of memory buffers where data could be written beyond allocated boundaries.

* **Bounds Checking:** The code includes some bounds checking (e.g., `if ((pps_id<0) || (pps_id >= 255)) return -1;`). While this doesn't directly prevent out-of-bounds writes, it suggests an awareness of potential buffer overflows.

* **Context:** The code snippet is part of a larger video decoding process.  Video codecs often have complex data structures and parsing rules, but they are generally designed to handle data within defined limits.

**Important Note:** To definitively rule out vulnerabilities, a thorough security audit of the entire video decoding software would be necessary.
