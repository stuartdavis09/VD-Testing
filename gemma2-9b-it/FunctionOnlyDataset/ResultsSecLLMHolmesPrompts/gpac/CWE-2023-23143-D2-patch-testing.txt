Answer: NO
Explanation: The provided code snippet does not exhibit any obvious signs of Out-of-bounds Write vulnerabilities. 

Here's why:

* **Buffer Size Checks:** The code includes checks for the bounds of variables like `pps_id` and `sps_id`. It ensures these values fall within acceptable ranges (0-255 and 0-31 respectively).
* **Safe Bitstream Operations:** The functions `gf_bs_read_ue_log` and `gf_bs_read_se_log` seem to be designed to safely read data from a bitstream (`bs`). They likely handle buffer boundaries internally.
* **Limited Direct Memory Access:** The code primarily deals with reading data from the bitstream and manipulating variables. There are no direct memory writes that could potentially go out of bounds without proper bounds checking.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Context is Crucial:** Without the full context of the `GF_BitStream` structure and the implementation of functions like `gf_bs_read_ue_log`, it's impossible to be absolutely certain. 
* **Indirect Access:**  While the code itself doesn't show direct out-of-bounds writes, there could be indirect vulnerabilities. For example, if a function used as input to `gf_bs_read_ue_log`  allows for manipulation of the bitstream pointer, that could lead to an out-of-bounds issue.
