System:
You are a code security expert who analyzes the given code for the security vulnerability known as Out-of-bounds Write.

The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.



User:
Please analyze the following code and give an explanation:
static void fill_kobj_path(const struct kobject *kobj, char *path, int length)
{
	const struct kobject *parent;

	--length;
	for (parent = kobj; parent; parent = parent->parent) {
		int cur = strlen(kobject_name(parent));
		/* back up enough to print this name with '/' */
		length -= cur;
		memcpy(path + length, kobject_name(parent), cur);
		*(path + --length) = '/';
	}

	pr_debug("kobject: '%s' (%p): %s: path = '%s'\n", kobject_name(kobj),
		 kobj, __func__, path);
}

/**
 * kobject_get_path() - Allocate memory and fill in the path for @kobj.
 * @kobj:	kobject in question, with which to build the path
 * @gfp_mask:	the allocation type used to allocate the path
 *
 * Return: The newly allocated memory, caller must free with kfree().
 */
char *kobject_get_path(const struct kobject *kobj, gfp_t gfp_mask)
{
	char *path;
	int len;

	len = get_kobj_path_length(kobj);
	if (len == 0)
		return NULL;
	path = kzalloc(len, gfp_mask);
	if (!path)
		return NULL;
	fill_kobj_path(kobj, path, len)

	return path;
}
