System:
You are a code security expert who analyzes the given code for the security vulnerability known as Out-of-bounds Write.

The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

But later if any word is present in `list` it is replaced by a censored version of that word. If the longest_word_length is 4 and the array `words` contains any of the words from `list` it will be replaced by its `censored` word that has a length of 5, causing an out-of-bound write. So, the code is vulnerable to out-of-bound write.']

User:
Please analyze the following code and give an explanation:
static void igb_set_rx_buffer_len(struct igb_adapter *adapter,
				  struct igb_ring *rx_ring)
{
	/* set build_skb and buffer size flags */
	clear_ring_build_skb_enabled(rx_ring);
	clear_ring_uses_large_buffer(rx_ring);

	if (adapter->flags & IGB_FLAG_RX_LEGACY)
		return;

	set_ring_build_skb_enabled(rx_ring);

#if (PAGE_SIZE < 8192)
	if (adapter->max_frame_size <= IGB_MAX_FRAME_BUILD_SKB)
        return;
    
    set_ring_uses_large_buffer(rx_ring);
#endif
}
