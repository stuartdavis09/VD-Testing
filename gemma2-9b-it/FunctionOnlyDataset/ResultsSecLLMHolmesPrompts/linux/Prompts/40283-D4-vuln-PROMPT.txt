System:
You are a code security expert who analyzes the given code for the security vulnerability known as Use After Free.

Referencing memory after it has been freed can cause a program to crash, use unexpected values, or execute code.

['#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nchar* data;\n\nvoid print_data() {\n    printf("%s\\n", data);\n    free(data);\n    data = NULL;\n}\n\nvoid data_operation(char** words, int num_words) {\n    char* init_data = "Data: ";\n    int data_len = strlen(init_data);\n    for (int i = 0; i < num_words; i++) {\n        data_len += strlen(words[i]) + 1;\n    }\n    data = malloc(data_len);\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < num_words; i++) {\n        if (words[i] == "shit" || words[i] == "damn") {\n            free(data);\n            break;\n        }\n        strcat(data, words[i]);\n        strcat(data, " ");\n    }\n    print_data();\n}', "Overview:\nThe code takes a list and the number of input words from user and concatenates them. It also stops concatenating if it finds given bad words in it. At the end it prints the data without bad words.\n\nSub-components:\nS1: `data` is freed in `data_operation` as well as `print_data` function -> check if `data` was used after it was freed causing a use after free vulnerability\n\nAnalysis:\nA-S1: in `data_operation` in second for loop, if a user input contains any bad words it frees the `data` memory and breaks the loop. Then after for loop the function `print_data` is called that prints `data` and frees it again. That'll lead to a free after use vulnerability\n\nDecison:\nBased on A-S1, the code is not safe from use-after-free vulnerability."]

User:
Please analyze the following code and give an explanation:
static int l2cap_sock_release(struct socket *sock)
{
	struct sock *sk = sock->sk;
	int err;
	struct l2cap_chan *chan;

	BT_DBG("sock %p, sk %p", sock, sk);

	if (!sk)
		return 0;

	bt_sock_unlink(&l2cap_sk_list, sk);

	err = l2cap_sock_shutdown(sock, SHUT_RDWR);
	chan = l2cap_pi(sk)->chan;

	l2cap_chan_hold(chan);
	l2cap_chan_lock(chan);

	sock_orphan(sk);
	l2cap_sock_kill(sk);

	l2cap_chan_unlock(chan);
	l2cap_chan_put(chan);

	return err;
}
