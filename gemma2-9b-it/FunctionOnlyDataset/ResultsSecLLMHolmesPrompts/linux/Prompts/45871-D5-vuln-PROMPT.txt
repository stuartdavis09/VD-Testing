System:
Analyze the given code for the security vulnerability known as Out-of-bounds Write.

The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

The length of any data from `words` cannot exceed the bound of `censored_words` as it is allocated based on the length of the longest word in `words`. On the other hand, `censor` is derived by `lookup` and is a censored version of a bad word from `censored`. The longest data in `censored` is 5 and it is not taken into consideration to allocate the `censored_words`. If the `longest_word_length` is 4 and the `words` contain words like 'shit', 'damn', or 'fool', then they will be replaced by 's***t', 'd***n', and 'f***l', respectively. These replaced words have a length of 5 and they will exceed the memory bound. So, there is a possibility of out-of-bound write or buffer overflow.\n\nDecision:\nBased on A-S1, the code is not safe from out-of-bound write or buffer overflow."]

User:
Please analyze the following code and give an explanation:
static void igb_set_rx_buffer_len(struct igb_adapter *adapter,
				  struct igb_ring *rx_ring)
{
	/* set build_skb and buffer size flags */
	clear_ring_build_skb_enabled(rx_ring);
	clear_ring_uses_large_buffer(rx_ring);

	if (adapter->flags & IGB_FLAG_RX_LEGACY)
		return;

	set_ring_build_skb_enabled(rx_ring);

#if (PAGE_SIZE < 8192)
	if (adapter->max_frame_size <= IGB_MAX_FRAME_BUILD_SKB)
        return;
    
    set_ring_uses_large_buffer(rx_ring);
