**Vulnerability: Integer Overflow in `gf_bs_read_int`**

The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability within the `gf_bs_read_int` function call. 

* **Path to Overflow:**
    - `gf_bs_read_int(bs, NbBits)` reads an integer from the bitstream `bs` with a specified number of bits `NbBits`. 
    - If `NbBits` is greater than 32, the result of `gf_bs_read_int` could exceed the maximum value an `s32` (signed 32-bit integer) can hold, leading to an integer overflow.

* **Impact:**
    - Integer overflow can cause unpredictable behavior. In this case, it could lead to incorrect calculations, buffer overflows, or crashes.
    - The code assumes that `value = gf_bs_read_int(bs, NbBits) - (1 << (NbBits-1))` will correctly handle the result, but this assumption is invalid if `NbBits` is too large.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Input Validation:** Validate the `NbBits` input to ensure it does not exceed 32.
2. **Safe Integer Handling:** Use data types with a larger capacity (e.g., `u64` for unsigned 64-bit integers) if necessary to avoid overflow.
3. **Overflow Checks:** Implement explicit checks for potential integer overflows after performing calculations involving `gf_bs_read_int`.
