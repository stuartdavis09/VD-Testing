System:
You are a security expert in detecting Out-of-bounds Write.
The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.
This is an example of vulnerable code:
----VULNERABLE CODE START-----
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

char list[3][4] = {"shit", "damn", "fool"};
char censored[3][5] = {"s***t", "d***n", "f***l"};

char* lookup(char* word)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    {
        if (word == list[i])
        {
            return censored[i];
        }
    }
    return NULL;
}

char** censor_words(char** words, int num_words, int longest_word_length){
    char** censored_words = (char**)malloc(num_words);
    for (int i = 0; i < num_words; i++)
    {
        censored_words[i] = (char*)malloc(longest_word_length);
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < num_words; i++)
    {
        char* censor = lookup(words[i]);
        if (censor != NULL)
        {
            censored_words[i] = censor;
        }
        else {
            censored_words[i] = words[i];
        }
    }

    return censored_words;
}

-----VULNERABLE CODE END-----

-----EXPLANATION OF VULNERABILITY-----
The `censored_words` array is allocated based on the length of the longest word from the user input `words`. But later if any word is present in `list` it is replaced by a censored version of that word. If the longest_word_length is 4 and the array `words` contains any of the words from `list` it will be replaced by its `censored` word that has a length of 5, causing an out-of-bound write. So, the code is vulnerable to out-of-bound write.
-----EXPLANATION END-----

This is an example of patched code:
-----PATCHED CODE 1 START-----
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

char list[3][4] = {"shit", "damn", "fool"};
char censored[3][5] = {"s***t", "d***n", "f***l"};
int longest_censored_word_length = 5;

char* lookup(char* word)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    {
        if (word == list[i])
        {
            return censored[i];
        }
    }
    return NULL;
}

char** censor_words(char** words, int num_words, int longest_word_length){
    char** censored_words = (char**)malloc(num_words);
    for (int i = 0; i < num_words; i++)
    {
        censored_words[i] = (char*)malloc(max(longest_censored_word_length, longest_word_length));
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < num_words; i++)
    {
        char* censor = lookup(words[i]);
        if (censor != NULL)
        {
            censored_words[i] = censor;
        }
        else {
            censored_words[i] = words[i];
        }
    }

    return censored_words;
}

-----PATCHED CODE 1 END-----

-----EXPLANATION OF PATCH-----
The `censored_words` array is allocated based on the length of the longest word from both the `censored` list and the user input `words`. So, later any word from `words` or `censored` cannot exceed the allocated memory bound, protecting it from an out-of-bound write. So, the code is not vulnerable to out-of-bound write.
