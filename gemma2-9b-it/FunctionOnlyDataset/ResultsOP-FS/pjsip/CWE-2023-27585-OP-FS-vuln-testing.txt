1. Vulnerability analysis: YES, THERE IS A VULNERABILITY
2. Explanation: 

The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow due to the way it handles DNS record parsing. Here's a breakdown:

* **Potential for Out-of-Bounds Access:** The `get_name_len` and `get_name` functions recursively traverse DNS records.  They rely on bounds checking (`if (p+1+label_len+1 > max)`) to ensure they don't read beyond the allocated memory (`max`). However, these checks rely on the integrity of the input DNS data.  

* **Vulnerability Scenario:**
    * An attacker could craft a malicious DNS packet with intentionally crafted labels or offsets.
    * By manipulating the length of labels or the offset values within the DNS record, an attacker could potentially cause `get_name_len` or `get_name` to read beyond the intended memory boundaries.

* **Impact:**  Overflowing a buffer can lead to:
    * **Crash:** The program may crash due to memory corruption.
    * **Data Corruption:**  Overwriting adjacent memory could corrupt other data structures, leading to unpredictable behavior.
    * **Code Execution:** In more severe cases, an attacker might be able to overwrite critical parts of the program's memory, potentially allowing them to execute arbitrary code.

**CWE Name:** CWE-120: Buffer Copy Without Checking Bounds
