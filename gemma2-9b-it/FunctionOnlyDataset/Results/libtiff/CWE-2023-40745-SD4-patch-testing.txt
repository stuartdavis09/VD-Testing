Answer: YES 

Explanation: 

The code snippet you provided demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability within the calculation of `iskew`. 

Here's why:

* **The Calculation:** `iskew = imagew - tilew * spp;` 
* **Potential Overflow:** If `imagew` is large and `tilew * spp` is also large, the result of this subtraction could exceed the maximum value an integer can hold (INT_MAX).  

**Consequences of Overflow:**

* **Incorrect Calculations:**  The `iskew` value will wrap around to a negative number, leading to incorrect calculations in subsequent parts of the code.
* **Unexpected Behavior:** This could cause the program to crash, produce incorrect image data, or even lead to denial-of-service conditions if it triggers infinite loops or memory corruption.

**Mitigation:**

To prevent this vulnerability, the code should perform bounds checking before performing the subtraction. A safer approach would be to use a larger integer type (e.g., `long long`) or to explicitly check if the result of the calculation could overflow.
