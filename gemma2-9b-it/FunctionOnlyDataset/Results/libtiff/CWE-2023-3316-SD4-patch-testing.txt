Answer: YES

Explanation: 

While the code attempts to mitigate NULL pointer dereference, there's still a potential vulnerability. 

Here's the breakdown:

1. **`tif != NULL` Check:** This is good practice, ensuring that the `TIFF` pointer is valid before proceeding.

2. **`tif->tif_closeproc` and `tif->tif_clientdata` Access:** The code accesses members (`tif_closeproc` and `tif_clientdata`) of the `tif` structure. If `tif` is NULL, these accesses will result in a crash or undefined behavior.

3. **`TIFFCleanup(tif)`:** This function call might be safe as long as `TIFFCleanup` itself handles NULL pointer checks. However, without knowing the implementation of `TIFFCleanup`, we cannot definitively say it's safe.

4. **`(void)(*closeproc)(fd)`:** This is where the potential vulnerability lies. 

   * **`closeproc`:**  This pointer is obtained from `tif->tif_closeproc`. If `tif` is NULL, `tif->tif_closeproc` will also be NULL.
   * **Dereferencing `closeproc`:** When `(*closeproc)(fd)` is executed, it attempts to dereference the NULL `closeproc` pointer, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. 

**Mitigation:**

The code should explicitly check if `tif_closeproc` is NULL before calling `(*closeproc)(fd)`.  A safe alternative might be to use a default close procedure if `tif_closeproc` is NULL.
