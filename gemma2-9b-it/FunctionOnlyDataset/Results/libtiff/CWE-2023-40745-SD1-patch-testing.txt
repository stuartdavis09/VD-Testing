Answer: YES 

Explanation: 

The code snippet you provided demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. Here's the breakdown:

* **The Issue:** The line `if ( iskew > INT_MAX ){ ... }` checks if the calculated `iskew` value exceeds the maximum value an `int` can hold (`INT_MAX`). If `iskew` overflows, the comparison will fail, and the error handling will be bypassed.

* **Consequences:**  An integer overflow in this context can lead to:
    * **Incorrect Calculations:**  Overflows can result in unexpected and potentially incorrect calculations throughout the rest of the code.
    * **Buffer Overruns:** If `iskew` is used to index into arrays or buffers, an overflow could cause a buffer overrun, allowing attackers to potentially write malicious data into unintended memory locations.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** An overflow could cause the program to crash or behave erratically, leading to a denial of service.

* **Mitigation:** To fix this vulnerability, you should:
    * **Use Larger Data Types:**  Consider using a data type with a larger range, such as `long` or `long long`, to store `iskew`.
    * **Bounds Checking:** Implement more robust bounds checking before using `iskew` in calculations or indexing.
