Answer: YES
Explanation: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. 

Here's why:

* **Unbounded Memory Allocation:** The `get_name_len` and `get_name` functions recursively parse domain names.  If a malicious input contains a very long domain name or a chain of recursive domain name references, it could lead to a stack overflow. The recursive calls keep adding function call frames to the stack, eventually exceeding the stack's allocated memory.

* **Potential Buffer Overflows:** 
    *  While the code checks for buffer boundaries (`if (p+1+label_len+1 > max)`) in some places, the checks might not be comprehensive enough, especially when dealing with complex domain name structures and recursive references.
    * The `pj_memcpy` calls could potentially write beyond the allocated memory if the input data is longer than expected.

**Impact:**

A successful buffer overflow attack could allow an attacker to:

* **Crash the application:** Overwriting critical memory can cause the application to crash.
* **Execute arbitrary code:** An attacker could carefully craft malicious input to overwrite the return address on the stack, redirecting execution flow to their own code.
* **Gain control of the system:** If the application has privileges, an attacker could potentially gain control of the entire system.


**Recommendations:**

* **Input Validation:** Carefully validate the length of domain names received as input. Limit the maximum allowed length to prevent excessive recursion.
* **Bounds Checking:** Implement more robust bounds checking to ensure that memory access operations stay within allocated boundaries.
* **Safe Memory Handling:** Use safer memory handling techniques like `strncpy` instead of `strcpy` to prevent buffer overflows.
* **Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR):**  Enable ASLR to make it harder for attackers to predict memory locations and exploit buffer overflows.
* **Stack Canaries:** Use stack canaries to detect stack overflows.
