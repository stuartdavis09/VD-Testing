Answer: YES
Explanation: 

The code is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. 

Here's why:

* **Unbounded Recursion:** The `get_name` and `get_name_len` functions recursively traverse the DNS name structure.  The `rec_counter` variable is meant to limit recursion depth, but it's possible for a maliciously crafted DNS packet to trigger excessive recursion, leading to a stack overflow.

* **Potential Buffer Overflow:**  The `pj_memcpy` calls in both functions, particularly when handling compressed DNS names, could lead to buffer overflows if the calculated `offset` or `label_len` values exceed the bounds of the allocated buffer.

**Example Scenario:**

An attacker could craft a DNS packet with a deeply nested compressed name structure.  The `get_name` function would repeatedly call itself, potentially exceeding the recursion limit and causing a stack overflow.  Alternatively, if the attacker manipulates the compressed name offsets, they could cause `pj_memcpy` to write data beyond the allocated buffer, overwriting critical memory regions and potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Stricter Recursion Limits:** Enforce a more stringent recursion limit in `get_name` and `get_name_len`. Consider using a constant limit rather than relying on the `rec_counter`.
2. **Bounds Checking:** Implement more robust bounds checking before each `pj_memcpy` call to ensure that the destination buffer is large enough to accommodate the data being copied.
3. **Input Validation:** Validate the contents of the DNS packet to ensure that it conforms to the expected format and that offsets and lengths are within acceptable ranges.
