Answer: NO
Explanation: The code you provided does not exhibit any obvious NULL pointer dereference vulnerabilities. 
It appears to be well-written in terms of NULL pointer checks. Here's why:

* **Explicit Checks:** The code consistently checks for NULL pointers before using them. For example:
    * `if (book == NULL) { return NULL; }`
    * `if (book_list_file == NULL) { return NULL; }`
    * `if (f == NULL) { return NULL; }`
    * `if (book_info == NULL) { printf("Book not found!\\n"; return NULL; }`
* **Error Handling:**  The code returns NULL in case of errors, indicating that a pointer is NULL. This allows the calling code to handle the NULL pointer situation gracefully.

Let me know if you have any other code snippets you'd like me to analyze.
