Answer: YES
Explanation: The code snippet you provided has a potential out-of-bounds write vulnerability. 
The vulnerability lies in the following line:
```c
	sprintf(devpath_string, "DEVPATH_OLD=%s", devpath);
```
Here's why this is a problem:
* **Format String Vulnerability:** The `sprintf` function is vulnerable to format string vulnerabilities if `devpath` is not properly sanitized. An attacker could craft a `devpath` that contains malicious code that could be executed.

**Potential Attack Scenario:**
An attacker could potentially craft a `devpath` that includes format specifiers that write beyond the bounds of `devpath_string`.

**Mitigation:**
* **Input Sanitization:**
* **Safe String Functions:**
