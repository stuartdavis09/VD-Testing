Answer: 2
Explanation:  The provided code snippet does not exhibit any obvious security vulnerabilities. 

Here's a breakdown of why:

* **Memory Management:** While the code does deallocate memory using `_TIFFfreeExt`, it appears to do so responsibly. There are no instances where memory is freed incorrectly or where a NULL pointer is dereferenced. 
* **Input Validation:** The code snippet doesn't involve handling any external user input, which is a common source of vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or injection attacks.
* **Data Sanitization:** There are no operations that process or store user-supplied data in a way that could lead to vulnerabilities.

**Important Note:**  A thorough security analysis would require examining the full context of the TIFF library, including functions not shown here, and considering potential vulnerabilities in the way it interacts with external systems or user input.
