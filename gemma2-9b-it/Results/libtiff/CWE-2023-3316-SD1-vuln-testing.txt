Answer: NO 
Explanation:  The provided code snippet does not exhibit any obvious security vulnerabilities. 

Here's a breakdown:

* **Memory Management:** The code focuses on cleaning up resources associated with a TIFF file. While it does involve freeing memory using `_TIFFfreeExt()`, it appears to do so in a controlled manner. There are no instances of using freed memory or dereferencing potentially NULL pointers in a way that could lead to buffer overflows or crashes.

* **Input Sanitization:** The code does not handle any user-supplied input.  Security vulnerabilities like injection attacks (SQL, command injection, etc.) are not applicable here.

* **Other Considerations:**
    * **`TIFFCleanup()`:** This function is designed to thoroughly release resources. The `if` conditions around calls to `TIFFFlush()` and `_TIFFfreeExt()` help ensure that operations are performed only when necessary.
    * **`TIFFClose()`:** This function correctly delegates the file closure to the `tif_closeproc` provided during file opening. This separation of concerns helps prevent issues.

**Important Note:** Without a deeper understanding of the `_TIFFfreeExt()` function and the broader TIFF library context, it's impossible to rule out subtle vulnerabilities. However, the provided code snippet itself does not raise immediate security concerns.
