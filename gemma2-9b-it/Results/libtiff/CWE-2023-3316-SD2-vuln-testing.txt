Answer: NO
Explanation: 

While the code snippet deals with memory management, it doesn't present a clear scenario for a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability.  Here's why:

* **Checks Before Dereferences:** The code includes checks before dereferencing pointers. For example:
    *  `if (tif->tif_mode != O_RDONLY)` before calling `TIFFFlush(tif)`.
    * `if (tif->tif_clientinfo)` before entering the loop to clean up client info links.
    * `if (tif->tif_rawdata && (tif->tif_flags & TIFF_MYBUFFER))` before freeing `tif->tif_rawdata`.
    *  `if (tif->tif_fields && tif->tif_nfields > 0)` before iterating through custom fields.

* **`_TIFFfreeExt` Handling:** The `_TIFFfreeExt` function likely handles memory deallocation safely, potentially including checks for NULL pointers.

* **Contextual Information:** It's important to note that without the full context of the `TIFFCleanup` function's usage and the definitions of `TIFFFlush`, `TIFFFreeDirectory`, `TIFFClientInfoLink`, `TIFFField`, etc., it's difficult to definitively rule out all possibilities. 

**Potential Areas for Further Review:**

* **External Dependencies:**  The code relies on functions like `TIFFFlush`, `TIFFFreeDirectory`, and `_TIFFfreeExt`.  It's essential to review the implementations of these functions to ensure they handle NULL pointers correctly.
* **Initialization:** Make sure that `tif` pointers are properly initialized before being used in the code.
