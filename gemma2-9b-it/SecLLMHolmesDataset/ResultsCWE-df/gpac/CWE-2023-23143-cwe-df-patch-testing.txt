3. Sanitizers: N/A
4. Unsanitized Data Flows: 
    1. (bs, `pps_id`,  The code reads `pps_id` from the bitstream without any sanitization. This could lead to an out-of-bounds access if `pps_id` is not within the valid range [0, 255].)
    2. (bs, `si->sps`, The code reads `si->sps` from the bitstream based on `si->pps->sps_id`.  The code does not sanitize `si->pps->sps_id`, which could lead to an out-of-bounds access if `si->pps->sps_id` is not within the valid range [0, 31].)
    3. (bs, `si->sps->log2_max_frame_num`,  The code reads `si->sps->log2_max_frame_num` from the bitstream. The code does not sanitize this value, which could lead to an out-of-bounds access if `si->sps->log2_max_frame_num` is not a valid log2 value for the given context. )
    4. (bs, `si->sps->poc_type`, The code reads `si->sps->poc_type` from the bitstream. The code does not sanitize this value, which could lead to an out-of-bounds access if `si->sps->poc_type` is not within the valid range [0, 1].)
    5. (bs, `si->sps->frame_mbs_only_flag`, The code reads `si->sps->frame_mbs_only_flag` from the bitstream. The code does not sanitize this value, which could lead to an out-of-bounds access if `si->sps->frame_mbs_only_flag` is not a valid boolean value.)
    6. (bs, `si->sps->ChromaArrayType`, The code reads `si->sps->ChromaArrayType` from the bitstream. The code does not sanitize this value, which could lead to an out-of-bounds access if `si->sps->ChromaArrayType` is not within the valid range for the given context.)
    7. (bs, `si->pps->num_ref_idx_l0_default_active_minus1`, The code reads `si->pps->num_ref_idx_l0_default_active_minus1` from the bitstream. The code does not sanitize this value, which could lead to an out-of-bounds access if `si->pps->num_ref_idx_l0_default_active_minus1` is not within the valid range for the given context.)
    8. (bs, `si->pps->num_ref_idx_l1_default_active_minus1`, The code reads `si->pps->num_ref_idx_l1_default_active_minus1` from the bitstream. The code does not sanitize this value, which could lead to an out-of-bounds access if `si->pps->num_ref_idx_l1_default_active_minus1` is not within the valid range for the given context.)
    9. (bs, `si->pps->slice_group_count`, The code reads `si->pps->slice_group_count` from the bitstream. The code does not sanitize this value, which could lead to an out-of-bounds access if `si->pps->slice_group_count` is not within the valid range for the given context.)
