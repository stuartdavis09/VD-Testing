## Vulnerability analysis: YES
**2. Explanation:
The issue lies within the `kobject_get_path_length function.  Let's break down the code and analyze the potential vulnerability.

```c
int get_kobj_path_length(const struct kobject *kobj)
{
	int length = 1;
	const struct kobject *parent = kobj;

	do {
		if (kobject_name(parent) == NULL)
			return 0;
		length += strlen(kobject_name(parent) + 1;
		parent = parent->parent;
	} while (parent);
	return length;
}
```

The problem occurs in the `while (parent);
