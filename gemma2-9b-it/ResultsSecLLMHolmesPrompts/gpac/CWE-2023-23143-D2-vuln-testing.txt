Answer: YES

Explanation: 

While the code snippet doesn't explicitly demonstrate an out-of-bounds write, it raises a strong possibility due to the handling of `pps_id` and potential buffer overflows.

Here's why:

1. **Unbounded Input:** The `gf_bs_read_ue_log` function reads a unsigned integer (`pps_id`) from the bit stream. There's no explicit check to ensure this input stays within the bounds of the `avc->pps` array, which has a size of 255.

2. **Potential Buffer Overflow:** If an attacker can manipulate the bit stream to produce a `pps_id` value greater than 255, it will lead to an out-of-bounds write. This could overwrite adjacent memory locations, potentially corrupting other data structures or even allowing for arbitrary code execution.

3. **Indirect Access:** The code uses `&avc->pps[pps_id]` to access the `pps` structure based on the potentially untrusted `pps_id` value. This indirect access makes it more difficult to statically analyze for buffer overflows.



**Mitigation:**

To prevent this vulnerability, the code should:

* **Validate `pps_id`:**  Add a check to ensure `pps_id` is within the valid range (0 to 255) before accessing the `avc->pps` array.
* **Bounds Checking:** Consider using safer memory access functions that perform bounds checking automatically, or implement custom bounds checking logic.
* **Input Sanitization:**  If possible, sanitize the input bit stream to prevent malicious `pps_id` values from being read.
