Answer: (1) YES

Explanation:

The code has a potential security vulnerability in the `limitMalloc` function. The function checks if the requested allocation size exceeds the maximum allowed size `maxMalloc` and returns `NULL` if it does. However, the function does not check if the requested allocation size is greater than the maximum allowed size for the entire program, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

For example, if an attacker can control the value of `s` in the `limitMalloc` function, they could potentially cause a buffer overflow by requesting a large allocation size. This could lead to arbitrary code execution.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if the requested allocation size is greater than the maximum allowed size for the entire program and return an error if it is.

Additionally, the code should also check for integer overflows when calculating the size of the allocation.
