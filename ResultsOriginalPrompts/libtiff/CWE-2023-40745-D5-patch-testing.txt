Answer: (1) YES

Explanation: The code has a potential security vulnerability in the `cpStripToTile` function. This function is used to copy data from one buffer to another, but it does not check for integer overflows when calculating the offset and length of the data to be copied. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability if the `outskew` or `inskew` variables are large enough to cause the calculated offset to exceed the bounds of the `out` buffer.

For example, if `outskew` is set to `(INT_MAX + 1)`, the calculated offset `out + outskew` will wrap around to a very large value, potentially causing a buffer overflow when the data is copied. Similarly, if `inskew` is set to `(INT_MAX + 1)`, the calculated offset `in + inskew` will also wrap around, potentially causing a buffer overflow.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should check for integer overflows when calculating the offset and length of the data to be copied, and ensure that the calculated offsets are within the bounds of the buffers.
