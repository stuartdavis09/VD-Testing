Answer: (1) YES

Explanation: The code is vulnerable to an integer overflow when calculating the `iskew` variable in the `DECLAREreadFunc(readSeparateTilesIntoBuffer)` function. The variable `iskew` is calculated as `imagew - tilew * spp`, where `imagew` is the raster scan line size, `tilew` is the tile width, and `spp` is the number of samples per pixel. If `imagew` is greater than `INT_MAX` and `tilew * spp` is also greater than `INT_MAX`, the subtraction will cause an integer overflow, resulting in a negative value for `iskew`. This can lead to incorrect calculations and potentially cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
