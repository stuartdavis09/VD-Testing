Answer: 2
Explanation: The code provided is a TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) processing program. It appears to be designed to copy and manipulate TIFF files. The code does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities. It does not have any buffer overflow or underflow issues, and it does not perform any operations that could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. The code also does not contain any obvious logical flaws, such as incorrect assumptions about the input data or incorrect handling of error conditions.
