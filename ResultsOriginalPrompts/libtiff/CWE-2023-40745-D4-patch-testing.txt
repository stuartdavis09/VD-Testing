Answer: (1) YES

Explanation: The code has a potential security vulnerability due to an integer overflow in the `cpStripToTile` function. The function is used to write data from a buffer to a tile in a TIFF image. The buffer size is calculated as `imagew * nrow`, where `imagew` is the width of the image and `nrow` is the number of rows in the tile. However, the function does not check if the buffer size is greater than the maximum allowed value for an integer, which is `INT_MAX`.

If the buffer size is greater than `INT_MAX`, the function will overflow and wrap around to a smaller value, potentially causing data corruption or leading to a crash. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the data in the buffer, potentially leading to a security vulnerability.

For example, if the image width is 1000000 and the number of rows in the tile is 100000, the buffer size would be 1000000000, which is greater than `INT_MAX`. In this case, the function would overflow and wrap around to a smaller value, potentially causing data corruption or leading to a crash.

To fix this vulnerability, the function should be modified to check if the buffer size is greater than `INT_MAX` and return an error if it is. Alternatively, the function could be modified to use a larger data type, such as a `uint64_t`, to store the buffer size.
