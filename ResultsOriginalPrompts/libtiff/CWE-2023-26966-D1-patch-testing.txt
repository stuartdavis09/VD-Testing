Answer: (1) YES

Explanation: The code contains instances of out-of-bounds write in the functions `Luv24fromXYZ` and `Luv24fromLuv48`. In these functions, the `luv` pointer is incremented without checking if it has reached the end of the buffer `sp->tbuf`. This can lead to writing beyond the bounds of the buffer, potentially causing a buffer overflow or underflow.
