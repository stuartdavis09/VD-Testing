Answer: (1) YES

Explanation: The code contains a function `Q_InverseQuantize` which is used to inverse quantize floating point values. The function takes four parameters: `Min`, `Max`, `NbBits`, and `value`. It returns a floating point value that is the inverse quantized value of `value` within the range `Min` to `Max`.

The issue is that the function does not properly handle the case where `value` is equal to `(1 << NbBits) - 1`. In this case, the function returns `Max` instead of the correct value. This can lead to an integer overflow when the function is called with a large `value` and `NbBits` is large.

For example, if `NbBits` is 32 and `value` is `0xFFFFFFFF`, the function will return `Max` instead of the correct value. This can cause the function to return an incorrect result, which can lead to a security vulnerability.

To fix this issue, the function should be modified to handle the case where `value` is equal to `(1 << NbBits) - 1` correctly. One way to do this is to add a special case to the function that returns the correct value in this case.
