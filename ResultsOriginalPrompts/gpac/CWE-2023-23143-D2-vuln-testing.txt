Answer: (1) YES

Explanation: The code is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. In the function `avc_parse_slice`, there is a section where it reads and writes data to the `pps` and `sps` arrays. The indices for these arrays are determined by the values read from the bitstream. However, the indices are not validated to ensure they are within the valid range of the arrays. This can lead to an out-of-bounds write if the indices are greater than or equal to the size of the arrays, which can cause a buffer overflow or underflow.
