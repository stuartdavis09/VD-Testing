The `data` is allocated for 1024 bytes and as we provide `fgets` with the `data` length of 1024, so it will read the data in the chucks of 1024 bytes. The program also allocates memory to `buffer` based on the lengths of the data and the static string added to it. This will never cause an out-of-bound write.
