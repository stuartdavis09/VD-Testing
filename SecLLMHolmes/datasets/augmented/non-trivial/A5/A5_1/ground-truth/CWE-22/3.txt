The code sanitizes and concatenates the environment variable `dir` with user input `file_name` without performing any input sanitization on `file_name`. Then it replaces whitespaces with the ‘-’ in `resolve_path` function and `path` is passed to `fopen`. However `resolve_path` does not sanitize for “..” or “%E2%E2” like path traversal entities. This can lead to a path traversal attack.
