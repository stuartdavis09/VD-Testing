In the `get_hostname` function the length of the `user_supplied_name` can be greater than the `MAX_NAME_LEN`, and the program does not provide `MAX_NAME_LEN` in `strncpy` however it provides the `len` provided by user which can be greater than `MAX_NAME_LEN` and can cause an out of bound write vulnerability.
