The user input `day` is passed to `create_output` and an output is created which consists of both user input and the SQL query results. Then the output is reflected back and rendered on the web page without proper validation or escaping on `day`. If `day` contains malicious scripts, they will be rendered as part of the HTML response and will be executed when the response is rendered by the browser.
