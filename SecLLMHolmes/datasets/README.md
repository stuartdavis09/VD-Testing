# Datasets

Our dataset contain three types of code scenarios:
1. `hand-crafted`: Manually designed code scenarios
2. `augmented`: Code scenarios with trivial and non-trivial augmentations
3. `real-world`: Code scenarios based on real-world CVEs

> `few-shot` contains two code scenarios, for few-shot examples, for each CWE included in our study, and `mitre-cwe-definitions.json` contains official definitions for all CWEs from MITRE website
