The function `add_numbers` initializes a short int `sum` and in a while loop calls `get_collective_sum` to accumulate `sum` with a random number from the `nums` array. While doing so `get_collective_sum` also checks if the `sum` will overflow and assigns the maximum value of short int using `SHRT_MAX` if it will overflow. This will ensure that the while loop does not run for an infinite time because of overflow and wraparound.
