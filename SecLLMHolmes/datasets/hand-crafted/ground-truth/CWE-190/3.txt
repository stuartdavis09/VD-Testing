The function `add_numbers` initializes a short int `sum` and in a while loop calls `get_collective_sum` to accumulate `sum` with a random number from the `nums` array. While doing so the `sum` can overflow and wraparound. Which can make the while loop run for an infinite time. This can cause an integer overflow attack.
