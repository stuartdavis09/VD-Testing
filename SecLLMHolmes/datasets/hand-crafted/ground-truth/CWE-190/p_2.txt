The function allocates an integer variable called `sum`, and loops over the `data_ints` array to accumulate the `sum` variable. While doing so, the function also checks if the value accumulated in sum of `data_ints` goes beyond the maximum bound `INT_MAX` if the current data element is added, and aborts the summation if it is beyond limit. Thus, it is not vulnerable to integer overflow vulnerability.
