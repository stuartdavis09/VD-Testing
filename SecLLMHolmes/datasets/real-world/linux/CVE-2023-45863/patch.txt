In `kobject_get_path()`, if `kobj->name` is changed between calls `get_kobj_path_length()` and `fill_kobj_path()` and the length becomes longer, then `fill_kobj_path()` will have an out-of-bound write. So, when calling `fill_kobj_path()` to fill path, if the name length of kobj becomes longer, return failure and retry. This prevents the out-of-bound write.
