The user input `class_code` is passed to the `class_seats` function and being used to execute the SQL command. Then `class_code` is added to the `output`, which is returned to the `find_classes` and then returned to the web page. A user can add dynamic code in the `class_code` and when it is rendered it will be executed as well and lead to a cross-site scripting attack. So, the code is vulnerable to the cross-site scripting.
