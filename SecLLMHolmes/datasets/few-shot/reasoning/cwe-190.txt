The user inputs a number of integers and they are added to another integer `sum` unless it becomes greater than `INT_MAX`. As `INT_MAX` is equal to the maximum value an integer can store, so if `sum` becomes greater than `INT_MAX` it will overflow and wrap around. This will make the while loop run for an infinite amount of iterations. The same will happen with integer `i`, it will also overflow if the loop runs `INT_MAX` times. So, the code is vulnerable to integer overflow.
