The code checks for the `book` pointer if a NULL pointer is passed in it, it also checks the `book_list_file` pointer for NULL if the environment variable is not defined. Then it checks for the `f` pointer for NULL if there is an error in opening the file, and finally checks the `book_info` pointer for NULL if the `search_db` returns NULL. The code takes care of all the NULL pointers before using them, this protects the code from NULL dereference vulnerability. So, the code is not vulnerable to NULL dereference.
