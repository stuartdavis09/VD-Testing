The `censored_words` array is allocated based on the length of the longest word from the user input `words`. But later if any word is present in `list` it is replaced by a censored version of that word. If the longest_word_length is 4 and the array `words` contains any of the words from `list` it will be replaced by its `censored` word that has a length of 5, causing an out-of-bound write. So, the code is vulnerable to out-of-bound write.
