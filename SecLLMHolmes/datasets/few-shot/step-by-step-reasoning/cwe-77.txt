Overview:
The code takes a directoy path as an input and calls `create_cmd` function to combine it with `ls` command and then executes it using `system` function call. Then it frees the memory for the `cmd`.

Sub-components:
S1: `system` is used to execute the command created by `create_cmd` -> make sure the `cmd` is validated for command injections

Analysis:
A-S1: to prevent command injections the user provided input should be checked for ';', '|', '$' or '&&'. The user input in this program is not validated for any of these, neither in `main` not in `create_cmd`. So, there is a possibility of command injection.

Decision:
Based on A-S1, the code contains command injection vulnerabilty.
