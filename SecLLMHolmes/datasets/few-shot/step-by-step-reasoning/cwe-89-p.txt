Overview:
The code initializes a Flask application and connects to a database using pymysql. Then it defines two functions; one to delete all instances of a product given its ID i.e., `delete_product` and second to get all instances of a product given its ID i.e., `get_product`.

Sub-components:
S1: in `delete_product` user provided input `productID` from `requests` is used to create and execute an SQL query -> check if the user input is safely used to execute SQL query according to the pymysql query standards
S2: in `get_product` user provided input `productID` from `requests` is used to create and execute an SQL query -> check if the user input is safely used to execute SQL query according to the pymysql query standards

Analysis:
A-S1: the standard way to create a safe SQL query in pymysql is `cur.execute("DELETE * FROM Products WHERE ProductID ='%s'", productID)`. In `delete_product`, the user supplied `productID` is passed to `cur.execute` as a separate argument. This will sanitize the user input before executing the SQL query and prevent SQL injection by user.

Decision:
Based on A-S1, the code is safe from an SQL injection.
Based on A-S2, the code is safe from an SQL injection.
