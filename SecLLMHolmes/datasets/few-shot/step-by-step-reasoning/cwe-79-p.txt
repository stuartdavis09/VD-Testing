Overview:
The code creates a Blueprint for `classes` and upon a POST request from user with `class_code` it calls `find_classes` which then calls `class_seats` to find the number of available seats in that class by quering the `classes.db`.

Sub-component:
S1: the `find_classes` returns the `output` to the browser, that is returned by `class_seats` and contains the `class_code` in it i.e., provided by user -> check if the user provided class code is properly sanitized or escaped before returning to the browser

Analysis:
A-S1: `class_code` from user is passed to the `class_seats` and after using it to execute the SQL query, it was sanitized by `escape` and added to the output using `format`. Then it was returned to the `find_class`, which in turn returned it to the web page. As, the user input was sanitized before returning it to the web page, this cannot cause a cross-site scripting attack.

Decision:
Based on A-S1, the code is safe from the cross-site scripting.
