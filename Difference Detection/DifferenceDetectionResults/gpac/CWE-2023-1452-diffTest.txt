1. Yes, the codes are different.

2. Difference: The second code has an additional condition in the `gf_text_get_utf8_line` function to check if the length of the converted string `szLineConv` exceeds the maximum length of the buffer `GF_ARRAY_LENGTH(szLineConv) - 1`. If it does, the function breaks the loop and returns the converted string.

3. Explanation: This difference means that the second code has added a check to prevent buffer overflow when converting a line of text to UTF-8. This is a good practice to ensure the code is more robust and less prone to errors.
