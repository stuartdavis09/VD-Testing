1. Yes, the codes are different.

2. Difference: In the second set of code, the condition `(pps_id<0) || (pps_id > 255)` in the line `if ((pps_id<0) || (pps_id > 255)) return -1;` has been changed to `(pps_id<0) || (pps_id >= 255)`.

3. Explanation: The difference is a minor change in the condition that checks the value of `pps_id`. In the original code, the condition checks if `pps_id` is less than 0 or greater than 255, which is correct according to the H.264 standard. However, in the modified code, the condition has been changed to check if `pps_id` is less than 0 or greater than or equal to 255. This change does not affect the functionality of the code, but it is a minor deviation from the standard.
