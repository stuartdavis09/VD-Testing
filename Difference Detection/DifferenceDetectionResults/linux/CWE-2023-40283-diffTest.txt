1. Yes, the codes are different.

2. Difference: The second set of code is missing the `l2cap_sock_teardown_cb` function, which is present in the first set of code.

3. Explanation: The `l2cap_sock_teardown_cb` function is a callback function that is used to handle the teardown of a L2CAP channel. Its absence in the second set of code may indicate that the teardown functionality has been removed or modified. This could potentially affect the behavior of the L2CAP socket layer, as it may not properly clean up resources associated with closed channels.
