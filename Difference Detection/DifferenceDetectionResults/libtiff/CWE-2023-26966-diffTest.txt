1. Yes, the codes are different.

2. Difference: The line `if (u != u || v != v)` in the function `uv_encode` is added in the second set of code.

3. Explanation: This difference means that the second set of code will check if `u` and `v` are not equal to themselves before proceeding with the encoding. This could be a bug fix or a change in the logic of the code to handle special cases.
