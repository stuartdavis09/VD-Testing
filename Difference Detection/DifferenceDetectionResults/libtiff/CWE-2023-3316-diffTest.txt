1. Yes, the codes are different.

2. Difference: In the second set of code, the function `TIFFClose` checks if `tif` is not `NULL` before calling `TIFFCleanup` and `(*closeproc)(fd)`, whereas in the first set of code, it does not have this check.

3. Explanation: The difference means that the second set of code is more robust and will not attempt to call `TIFFCleanup` and `(*closeproc)(fd)` if `tif` is `NULL`. This could potentially cause a segmentation fault or other unexpected behavior. By adding the check, the second set of code ensures that these functions are only called if `tif` is a valid pointer, which is a good practice in C programming.
